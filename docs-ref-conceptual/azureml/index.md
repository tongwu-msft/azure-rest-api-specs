# Machine Learning REST API reference (preview)

[Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/) is a cloud service that you use to train, deploy, automate, and manage machine learning models, all at the broad scale that the cloud provides.

The REST APIs allow you to develop clients that use REST calls to work with the service. These APIs are complimentary to [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/?view=azure-ml-py), and provide flexibility in automating your machine learning activities such as submitting an experiment and monitoring the test results. 

## Rest Operation Groups

Machine Learning REST APIs provide operations for working with the following resources:

| Operation group | Description                                                        |
