# Machine Learning REST API reference
The [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/) REST APIs allow you to develop clients that use REST calls to work with the service. These APIs are complementary to the control-plane [Azure Machine Learning Python SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/?view=azure-ml-py) for provisioning and managing Azure ML workspaces and compute. 

## Rest Operation Groups

Machine Learning REST APIs provide operations for working with the following resources:

| Operation group | Description                                                        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Workspaces and Compute](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azureml/workspacesandcomputes/machinelearningcompute) | Provides operations on Workspaces and Compute resources of Azure Machine Learning|
