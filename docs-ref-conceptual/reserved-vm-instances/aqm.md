# Azure Automated Quota Management REST API (Preview)

Automated Quota Management allows Azure to automatically adjust the [service limits (quota)](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) for enrolled subscriptions based on customer resource usage.

The Azure Automated Quota Management REST API allows to enroll for automatic management of [service limits (quota)](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) for the resources programmatically. 

After subscription is enabled, Azure will manage [service limits (quota)](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) for your resources.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The APIs currently support Azure Virtual Machines (cores/vCPU) service limits (quota).

Using the API, you can:
* Enable or disable automatic management of service limits (quota) for supported resources.
* Update notification preferences for automatic management of service limits (quota).
* Get the enrollment status and notification preferences for automatic management of service limits (quota).


## Private Preview

Automated Quota Management API is in **private preview**. Review the [reference](xref:management.azure.com.reserved-vm-instances.autoquotaincrease)  documentation for API details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Automated quota management is in limited preview with select partners and customers through **invitation** only.
