# Azure Time Series Insights Gen1 Query API

This article describes various REST Query APIs. REST APIs are service endpoints that support sets of HTTP operations (methods), which enable you to query Azure Time Series Insights Gen1 environments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * Azure Time Series Insights Gen1 uses the HTTPS Protocol for the [Get Environments](#get-environments-api), [Get Environment Availability](#get-environment-availability-api), [Get Metadata](#get-environment-metadata-api), [Get Environment Events](#get-environment-events-api), and [Get Environment Aggregates](#get-environment-aggregates-api) APIs.
> * Azure Time Series Insights Gen1 uses the WebSocket Secure (WSS) Protocol for the [Get Environment Events Streamed](#get-environment-events-streamed-api) and [Get Aggregates Streamed](#get-environment-aggregates-streamed-api) APIs.

## Get Environments API

The Get Environments API returns the list of environments that the caller is authorized to access.

* Endpoint and operation:

  ```URL
  GET https://api.timeseries.azure.com/environments?api-version=2016-12-12
  ```

* Example request body: Not applicable

* Example response body:

    ```JSON
    {
      "environments": [
        {
          "displayName":"Sensors",
          "environmentFqdn": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.env.timeseries.azure.com",
          "environmentId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
          "resourceId": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/RdxProdAssetsEastUs/providers/Microsoft.TimeSeriesInsights/environments/Sensors",
          "roles": [
            "Reader",
            "Contributor"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > The response property **environmentFqdn** is a unique, fully-qualified domain name for the environment that's used in per-environment Query API requests.

## Get Environment Availability API

The Get Environment Availability API returns the distribution of event count over the event timestamp **$ts**. Environment availability is cached, and the response time does not depend on the number of events in an environment.

> [!TIP]
> The Get Environment Availability API can be used to initialize a front-end UI experience.

* Endpoint and operation:

  ```URL
  GET https://<environmentFqdn>/availability?api-version=2016-12-12
  ```

* Example request body: Not applicable

* Example response body:

    ```JSON
    {
      "range": {
        "from": "2016-08-01T01:02:03Z",
        "to": "2016-08-31T03:04:05Z"
      },
      "intervalSize": "1h",
      "distribution": {
        "2016-08-01T00:00:00Z": 123,
        "2016-08-31T03:00:00Z": 345
      }
   }
   ```

   An empty object is returned for environments with no events.

## Get Environment Metadata API

The Get Environment Metadata API returns environment metadata for a given search span. Metadata is returned as a set of property references. Azure Time Series Insights Gen1 internally caches and approximates metadata and may return more properties that are present in the exact events in the search span.

* Endpoint and operation:

  ```URL
  POST https://<environmentFqdn>/metadata?api-version=2016-12-12
  ```

* Input payload structure:

  * Search span clause (mandatory)

* Example request body:

   ```JSON
   {
     "searchSpan": {
       "from": {"dateTime":"2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z"},
       "to": {"dateTime":"2016-08-31T00:00:00.000Z"}
     }
   }
   ```

* Example response body:

   ```JSON
   {
     "properties": [
       {
         "name": "sensorId",
         "type": "String"
       },
       {
         "name": "sensorValue",
         "type": "Double"
       },
       {
         "name": "iothub-connection-device-id",
         "type": "String"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
  
  An empty `properties` array is returned when the environment is empty or there are no events in a search span.
  
  Built-in properties are not returned in the list of properties.

## Get Environment Events API

The Get Environment Events API returns a list of raw events that match the search span and predicate.

* Endpoint and operation:

  ```URL
  POST https://<environmentFqdn>/events?api-version=<apiVersion>
  ```

* Input payload structure:

  * Search span clause (mandatory)
  * Predicate clause (optional)
  * Limit clause (mandatory)

* Example request body:

    ```JSON
    {
      "searchSpan": {
        "from": {
          "dateTime": "2019-12-30T00:00:00.000Z"
        },
        "to": {
          "dateTime": "2019-12-31T23:00:00.000Z"
        }
      },
      "predicateString": "PointValue.Double = 3.14",
      "top": {
        "sort": [
          {
            "input": {
              "builtInProperty": "$ts"
            },
              "order": "Asc"
            }
        ],
        "count": 1000
      }
   }
   ```

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > * Nested sorting (that is, sorting by two or more properties) is currently not supported.
  > * Events can be sorted and limited to the top.
  > * Sorting is supported on all property types. Sorting relies on comparison operators that are defined for *Boolean expressions*.

* Example response body:

    ```JSON
    {
      "warnings": [],
      "events": [
        {
          "schema": {
            "rid": 0,
            "$esn" : "buildingsensors",
            "properties" : [{
              "name" : "sensorId",
              "type" : "String"
            }, {
              "name" : "sensorValue",
              "type" : "String"
            }]
          },
          "$ts" : "2016-08-30T23:20:00Z",
          "values" : ["IndoorTemperatureSensor", 72.123]
        }, {
          "schemaRid" : 0,
          "$ts" : "2016-08-30T23:21:00Z",
          "values" : ["IndoorTemperatureSensor", 72.345]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Get Environment Events Streamed API

The Get Environment Events Streamed API returns a list of raw events that match the search span and predicate.

This API uses the WebSocket Secure Protocol to do streaming and return partial results. It always returns additional events. That is, the new message is additive to the previous one. The new message contains new events that were not in the previous message. The previous message should be kept when the new message is added.

* Endpoint and operation:

  ```URL
  GET wss://<environmentFqdn>/events?api-version=<apiVersion>
  ```

* Input payload structure:

  * Search span clause (mandatory)
  * Predicate clause (optional)
  * Limit clause (mandatory)

* Example request message:

    ```JSON
    {
      "headers" : {
        "Authorization":"Bearer <YOUR_AAD_OAUTH_TOKEN>",
        "x-ms-client-request-id" : "132gae-w343-41a1-2342-w23ta4532"
      },
      "content": {
        "searchSpan": {
          "from": "2017-04-30T23:00:00.000Z",
          "to": "2017-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"
        },
        "top": {
          "sort": [
            {
              "input": {
                "builtInProperty": "$ts"
              },
              "order": "Asc"
            }
          ],
          "count": 1000
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Get Environment Aggregates API

The Get Environment Aggregates API groups events by a specified property as it optionally measures the values of other properties.

> [!NOTE]
> Bucket boundaries support *10ⁿ*, *2×10ⁿ*, or *5×10ⁿ* values to align with and better support numeric histograms.

* Endpoint and operation:

  ```URL
  POST https://<environmentFqdn>/aggregates?api-version=<apiVersion>
  ```

* Input payload structure:

  * Search span clause (mandatory)
  * Predicate clause (optional)
  * Aggregates clause (mandatory)

* Example request body:

          }
        }
      ],
      "warnings": []
    }
    ```

    If no measure expressions are specified and the list of events is empty, the response will be empty.

    If measures are present, the response contains a single record with a `null` dimension value, a `0` value for count, and a `null` value for other kinds of measures.

## Get Environment Aggregates Streamed API

The Get Environment Aggregates Streamed API groups events by a specified property as it optionally measures the values of other properties:

* This API uses the WebSocket Secure Protocol for streaming and to return partial results.
* It always returns a replacement (snapshot) of all the values.
* Previous packets can be discarded by the client.

> [!NOTE]
> Bucket boundaries support *10ⁿ*, *2×10ⁿ*, or *5×10ⁿ* values to align with and better support numeric histograms.

* Endpoint and operation:

  ```URL
  GET wss://<environmentFqdn>/aggregates?api-version=<apiVersion>
  ```

* Input payload structure:

  * Search span clause (mandatory)
  * Predicate clause (optional)
  * Aggregates clause (mandatory)

* Example request message:

    ```JSON
    {
      "headers":{

## Error handling and resolution

### Property Not Found behavior

For properties referenced in the query, either as part of predicates or part of aggregates (measures), by default, the query tries to resolve the property in the global search span of the environment. If the property is found, the query succeeds. If the property is not found, the query fails.

However, you can modify this behavior to treat properties as existing but with `null` values if they are not present in the environment. You do this by setting the optional request header `x-ms-property-not-found-behavior` with the value `UseNull`.

Possible values for the request header are `UseNull` or `ThrowError` (default). When you set `UseNull` as the value, the query will succeed even though the properties do not exist, and the response will contain warnings that display the properties that are not found.

### Report unresolved properties

You can specify property references for predicate, dimension, and measure expressions. If a property with a specific name and type doesn't exist for a specified search span, an attempt is made to resolve a property over a global time span.

Depending on the success of resolution, the following warning or error might be emitted:

* If a property exists in the environment over a global time span, it is resolved appropriately, and a warning is emitted to notify you that the value of this property is `null` for a given search span.
* If a property does not exist in the environment, an error is emitted, and the query execution fails.

### Error responses

If the query execution fails, the JSON response payload contains an error response with the following structure:

```JSON
{
  "error" : {
    "code" : "...",
    "message" : "...",
    "innerError" : {  
      "code" : "...",
      "message" : "...",
    }
  }
}
```

Here, `innerError` is optional. In addition to basic errors, such as a malformed request, the following errors are returned:

| HTTP status code | Error code | Example of error message | Possible inner error codes |
|-|-|-|-|
| 400 | InvalidApiVersion | "API version '2016' is not supported. Supported versions are '2016-12-12'." | |

| 400 | InvalidInput | "Multiple aggregates are not supported." | |
| 400 | InvalidInput | "Predicate property not found." | `PropertyNotFound` |
| 400 | InvalidInput | "Measure property not found." | `PropertyNotFound` |
| 400 | InvalidInput | "Dimension property not found." | `PropertyNotFound` |
| 400 | InvalidInput | "Number of measures exceeded limit." | `NumberOfMeasuresExceededLimit` |
| 400 | InvalidInput | "Aggregate depth exceeded limit." | `AggregateDepthExceededLimit` |

| 400 | InvalidInput | "Response size exceeded limit." | `ResponseSizeExceededLimit` |
| 400 | InvalidInput | "Event count exceeded limit." | `EventCountExceededLimit` |
| 400 | InvalidInput | "Property reference count exceeded limit." | `PropertyReferenceCountExceededLimit` |
| 400 | InvalidMethod | "Only WebSocket requests are allowed on the path 'aggregates'." | |
| 400 | InvalidUrl | "The request URL '/a/b' could not be parsed." | |
| 408 | RequestTimeout | "Request timed out after '30' second(s)." | |
| 503 | TooManyRequests | "Concurrent request count of '10' exceeded for environment '95880732-01b9-44ea-8d2d-4d764dfe1904'." | `EnvRequestLimitExceeded` |

### Warnings

A Query API response may contain a list of warnings as `"warnings"` entry under the root of the HTTP response or WebSocket response message. Currently warnings are generated if property is not found for a given search span but is found in an environment for global time span. It is also generated when the header `x-ms-property-not-found-behavior` is set to `UseNull` and a property that is referenced does not exist even in the global search span.

Each warning object may contain the following fields:

| Field name | Field type | Notes |
|--|--|--|
| **code** | **String** | One of the predefined warning codes |
| **message** | **String** | A detailed warning message |
| **target** | **String** | A dot-separated JSON path to the JSON input payload entry causing the warning |
| **warningDetails** | **Dictionary** | Optional; additional warning details (for example, the position in predicate string) |

The following code presents examples of warnings for predicate, predicate string within predicate, dimension, and measure:

```JSON
"warnings": [
  {
    "code": "PropertyNotFound",
    "message": "Predicate property 'X' of type 'String' is not found in local search span.",
    "target": "predicate.and[0].eq.left.property.name"
  },
  {
    "code": "PropertyNotFound",
    "message": "Predicate string property 'X' is not found in local search span.",
    "target": "predicate.and[1].predicateString",
    "warningDetails": {
      "startPos": 1,
      "endPos": 2,
      "line": 1,
      "col": 1
    }
  },
  {
    "code": "PropertyNotFound",
    "message": "Dimension property 'X' of type 'String' is not found in local search span.",
    "target": "aggregates.dimension.uniqueValues.input.property"
  },
  {
    "code": "PropertyNotFound",
    "message": "Measure property 'X' of type 'String' is not found in local search span.",
    "target": "aggregates.aggregates.measures[0].min.input.property"
  }
]
```
