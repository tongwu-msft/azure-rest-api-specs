# Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 API limits

This article describes the throughput, request, and concurrency limitations of the Time Series model and query APIs.

## Model API - limits

The following limits are applied during query execution to fairly utilize resources among multiple environments and users:

| Applicable APIs | Limit name | Limit value | SKUs affected |
|-|-|-|-|
| All | Max number of TSM objects per request | 10,000 or 8 MB | Gen2 |
| All | Max model request execution time | 30 seconds | Gen2 |
| All | Max number of instances per environment | 1,000,000 | Gen2 |
| All | Max number of instance fields per instance | 100 | Gen2 |
| All | Max number of types per environment | 1,000 | Gen2 |
| All | Max number of variables per type | 50 | Gen2 |
| All | Max number of hierarchies per environment | 32 | Gen2 |
| All | Max number of hierarchies associated with an instance | 32 | Gen2 |
| All | Max hierarchy depth | 32 | Gen2 |
| All | Max number of characters in type name, hierarchy name, instance fields name, Time Series ID property value, Time Series ID each property name, Time Series name | 1,024 | Gen2 |
| All | Max size per instance | 16 KB | Gen2 |

## Query APIs - limits

The following limits are applied during query execution to evenly utilize resources among environments and users:
