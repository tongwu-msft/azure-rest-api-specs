# Azure Time Series Insights Gen1 data access

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a Gen1 article.

There are three ways to access and view your data in Azure Time Series Insights Gen1. You can query by using the [Azure Time Series Insights Gen1 Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/time-series-insights/time-series-quickstart), create a query on behalf of an environment to be deployed through a custom URL, or create a custom application by using the Azure Time Series Insights Gen1 Query APIs.

You can use the Azure Time Series Insights Gen1 Query APIs to perform REST **CREATE**, **READ**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** operations against GA environments through the [Gen1 query syntax](gen1-query-syntax.md). The APIs allow you to:

* Use the Azure Time Series Insights Gen1 scalable platform for analysis on the fly.
* Chunk time series intervals.
* Store low-latency time series data.
* Take advantage of Azure security and identity management.
* Perform repeated operations reliably.
* Stream events through secure WebSockets.

This article summarizes data-access capabilities in the Gen1 APIs.

Review the [Gen1 query syntax](gen1-query-syntax.md).
