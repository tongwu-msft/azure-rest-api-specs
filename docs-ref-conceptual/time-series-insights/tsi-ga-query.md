Time Series Insights enables you to query and view the data in your Time Series Insights environments three ways. You can query with the Time Series Insights explorer, create a query on behalf of an environment to be deployed using a custom URL, or you can create a custom application using the [Time Series Insights query API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/time-series-insights/time-series-insights-reference-queryapi) to achieve scenarios such as:

- Leverage Time Series Insights scalable platform for ad-hoc analysis on the fly
- Time series interval chunking
- Low latency time series data storage
- Leverage best-in-class Azure security and identity management
- Perform repeated operations with reliability and ease
