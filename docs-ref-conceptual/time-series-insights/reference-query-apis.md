# Azure Time Series Insights Gen2 Query APIs

The [Query APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/time-series-insights/dataaccessgen2/query/execute) are constituted by three REST APIs, one API each for *events*, *series*, and *aggregates*.

The Query APIs return *event schema* and event counts over a specified time range through HTTP **GET** requests with optional pagination. *Series* and *aggregate series* information is also exposed through **GET** operations with optional pagination.

| API | Description
| --- | --- |
| [Get Events API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/time-series-insights/dataaccessgen2/query/execute#getevents) | Returns a list of raw events that match the search span and predicate. |
| [Get Series API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/time-series-insights/dataaccessgen2/query/execute#getseries) | Enables query and retrieval of Time Series Insights data from captured events by using data recorded on the wire through the variables defined in the model or provided inline. |
| [Aggregate Series API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/time-series-insights/dataaccessgen2/query/execute#aggregateseries) | Enables query and retrieval of Time Series Insights data from captured events by aggregating recorded data by using the aggregate or sample functions. |

The APIs also support a [variety of customized operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/time-series-insights/dataaccessgen2/query/execute#examples) specified through the HTTP request JSON body. [Query definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/time-series-insights/dataaccessgen2/query/execute#definitions) can be used for common operations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * As part of the [upcoming changes to JSON flattening and escaping rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/time-series-insights/ingestion-rules-update), arrays will be stored as **Dynamic** type. Payload properties stored as this type are **ONLY accessible through the Get Events API**.

## Error responses

If query execution fails, the JSON response payload will contain an error response that conforms to the following structure:

```JSON
{
    "error" : {
        "code" : "...",
        "message" : "...",
        "innerError" : {  
            "code" : "...",
            "message" : "...",
        }
    }
}
```

Here, `innerError` is optional. In addition to basic errors like malformed request, the following errors are returned:

| Http status code | Error code | Example error message | Possible innerError codes |

Tools that assist with testing HTTP requests and responses include:

* [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler). This free web debugging proxy can intercept your REST requests, so you can diagnose the HTTP request and response messages.
* [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/). You can use this tool to quickly dump the claims in your bearer token and then validate their contents.
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). This is a free HTTP request and response testing tool for debugging REST APIs.
