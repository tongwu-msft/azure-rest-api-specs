# Azure Time Series Insights Query API

This document describes various REST query APIs. REST APIs are service endpoints that support sets of HTTP operations (methods), which enable you to query Time Series Insights environments. 

To better understand the API calls described in this document, see [Azure Time Series Insights Query Syntax](ga-query-syntax.md).

## Components of a REST API request/response

Time Series Insights uses the HTTPS protocol for Get Environments, Get Availability, Get Metadata API.

Time Series Insights uses secure WebSockets protocol (WSS) for Get Aggregates and Get Events.

A REST API request/response pair can be separated into the following components:

- HTTP **method**: Time Series Insights query APIs support GET and POST methods. GET is used for requests that do not require method body and for WebSocket requests.

- The **request URI**, which consists of `{URI-scheme} :// {URI-host} / {resource-path} ? {query-string}`. 
  - `{URI scheme}` indicates the protocol used to transmit the request. Time Series Insights API uses HTTPS and WSS (secure WebSockets) depending on API.
  - URI host: 
    - `api.timeseries.azure.com` for Get Environments API
    - \<environmentFqdn> for per-environment APIs. You can obtain this domain name from the response of the Get Environments API, Azure portal, or Azure Resource Manager. For example, `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.env.timeseries.azure.com`
  - Resource path: For example, environments can be used to query the list of Time Series Insights environments available for user.
  - Query string: Required parameter is api-version. For example, `api-version=2016-12-12`

- HTTP **request header** fields: For example, an Authorization header that provides a bearer token containing client authorization information for the request. For WebSocket requests, Authorization header and other headers are sent in the message under the headers container. See examples in the APIs below.

- HTTP **request message body**: optional for GET requests, and required for POST requests. Only JSON-encoded body is supported.

- HTTP **response message header** fields:
  - An HTTP status code: 200 for successful requests, or 4xx or 5xx for errors. For more information, see Errors section.
  - Optional additional header fields, as required to support the request's response, such as a Content-type response header.

- HTTP **response message body**: JSON encoded response data.
 
Depending on your application, you may also need to register your client application with Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Authentication and authorization for Azure Time Series Insights API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/time-series-insights/time-series-insights-authentication-and-authorization).


## Common Headers and Parameters

Required URL query string parameters:
- `api-version=2016-12-12` – currently only supported API version.

Required request headers:

- `Authorization` for authentication and authorization, valid OAuth2.0 Bearer token must be passed in [Authorization header](/rest/api/). The token must be issued to `https://api.timeseries.azure.com/` resource (also known as "audience" in the token).

Optional URL query string parameters:
- `timeout=<timeout>` – server-side timeout for the request execution. Applicable only for Get Environment Events and Get Environment Aggregates API. Timeout value should be in ISO 8601 duration format, for example "PT20S" and should be in the range 1-30s. Default value is 30s.

Optional request headers:
- `Content-type` - if specified, only `application/json` is supported.
- `x-ms-client-request-id` - a client request ID. Service records this value. Allows the service to trace operation across services.
- `x-ms-client-session-id` - a client session ID. Service records this value. Allows the service to trace a group of related operations across services.
- `x-ms-client-application-name` - name of the application that generated this request. Service records this value.
- `x-ms-property-not-found-behavior` - Possible values are  `ThrowError` (default) or `UseNull`. See [here](#property-not-found-behavior).

Response headers:
- `Content-type` - only `application/json` is supported.
- `x-ms-request-id` - server-generated request ID. Can be used to contact Microsoft to investigate a request.

## Get Environments API

`GET https://api.timeseries.azure.com/environments?api-version=2016-12-12`

The Get Environments API returns the list of environments that the caller is authorized to access.

Request Body: None

Response Body:
```json
{
    "environments": [
        {
            "displayName":"Sensors",
            "environmentFqdn": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.env.timeseries.azure.com",
            "environmentId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
	     "resourceId":
"/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/RdxProdAssetsEastUs/providers/Microsoft.TimeSeriesInsights/environments/Sensors"
        }
    ]
}

```

Here, `environmentFqdn` is unique fully qualified domain name for environment used in per-environment query API requests.

## Get Environment Availability API

`GET https://<environmentFqdn>/availability?api-version=2016-12-12`

The get Environments Availability API returns the distribution of event count over the event timestamp `$ts`. This API can be used to provide landing experience of navigating to the environment.

Request Body: None

Response Body:
```json
{
    "range": {
        "from": "2016-08-01T01:02:03Z",
        "to": "2016-08-31T03:04:05Z"
    },
    "intervalSize": "1h",
    "distribution": {
        "2016-08-01T00:00:00Z": 123,
        "2016-08-31T03:00:00Z": 345
    }
}
```

An empty object is returned for environments with no events. Environment availability is cached, and the response time does not depend on the number of events in an environment.

## Get Environment Metadata API

`POST https://<environmentFqdn>/metadata?api-version=2016-12-12`

The Get Environments Metadata API returns environment metadata for a given search span. Metadata is returned as a set of property references.

Input payload structure:
* Search span clause (mandatory).

Request Body:
```json
{
    "searchSpan": {
        "from": {"dateTime":"2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z"},
        "to": {"dateTime":"2016-08-31T00:00:00.000Z"}
    }
}
```

Response Body:
```json
{
    "properties": [
        {
            "name": "sensorId",
            "type": "String"
        },
        {
            "name": "sensorValue",
            "type": "Double"
        }
    ]
}
```

Time Series Insights internally caches and approximates metadata and may return more properties that are present in the exact events in the search span.
An empty `properties` array is returned when the environment is empty or there are no events in a search span.
Built-in properties are not returned in the list of properties.

## Get Environment Events API

`POST https://<environmentFqdn>/events?api-version=<apiVersion>`

The Get Environment Events API returns a list of raw events matching the search span and predicate.

Input payload structure:
* Search span clause (mandatory).
* Predicate clause (optional).
* Limit clause (mandatory).

Payload examples (`predicate` and `searchSpan` are omitted for clarity):

Request Body:
```json
{
    "searchSpan" : {...},
    "predicate" : {...},
    "top" : {
        "sort" : [{
            "input" : {
                "builtInProperty" : "$ts"
            },
            "order" : "Asc"
        }],
        "count" : 1000
    }
}
```

Response Body:
```json
{
    "events" : [{
            "schema" : {
                "rid" : 0,
                "$esn" : "buildingsensors",
                "properties" : [{
                        "name" : "sensorId",
                        "type" : "String"
                    }, {
                        "name" : "sensorValue",
                        "type" : "String"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "$ts" : "2016-08-30T23:20:00Z",
            "values" : ["IndoorTemperatureSensor", 72.123]
        }, {
            "schemaRid" : 0,
            "$ts" : "2016-08-30T23:21:00Z",
            "values" : ["IndoorTemperatureSensor", 72.345]
        }
    ]
}
```

Events can be sorted and limited to the top.
Sorting is supported on all property types. Sorting relies on comparison operators defined for *boolean expressions*.

> [!NOTE]
> Nested sorting (sort by two or more properties) is currently not supported.

## Get Environment Events Streamed API

`GET wss://<environmentFqdn>/events?api-version=<apiVersion>`

The Get Environment Events API returns a list of raw events matching the search span and predicate.

This API uses Web Sockets to do streaming and return partial results. It always returns additional events, that is, new message is additive to the previous one. New message contains new events that were not in the previous message. The previous message should be kept and accumulated with the new message.

Input payload structure:
* Search span clause (mandatory).
* Predicate clause (optional).
* Limit clause (mandatory).

Payload examples (`predicate` and `searchSpan` are omitted for clarity):

Request Message:
```json
{
    "headers" : {
        "Authorization" : "Bearer ... ",
        "x-ms-client-request-id" : "06be6306-..."
    },
    "content" : {
        "searchSpan" : {...},
        "predicate" : {...},
        "top" : {
            "sort" : [{
                "input" : {
                    "builtInProperty" : "$ts"
                },
                "order" : "Asc"
            }],
            "count" : 1000
        }
    }
}
```

Response Message:
```json
{
    "headers" : {
        "x-ms-request-id" : "fa15156a-..."
    },
    "content" : {
        "events" : [{
                "schema" : {
                    "rid" : 0,
                    "$esn" : "buildingsensors",
                    "properties" : [{
                            "name" : "sensorId",
                            "type" : "String"
                        }, {
                            "name" : "sensorValue",
                            "type" : "String"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "$ts" : "2016-08-30T23:20:00Z",
                "values" : ["IndoorTemperatureSensor", 72.123]
            }, {
                "schemaRid" : 0,
                "$ts" : "2016-08-30T23:21:00Z",
                "values" : ["IndoorTemperatureSensor", 72.345]
            }
        ]
    },
    "percentCompleted" : 100.0
}
```

Events can be sorted and limited to the top.
Sorting is supported on all property types. Sorting relies on comparison operators defined for *boolean expressions*.

> [!NOTE]
> Nested sorting (sort by two or more properties) is currently not supported.

## Get Environment Aggregates API

The Get Environment Aggregates API groups events by given property with optionally measuring values of other properties.

Input payload structure:
* Search span clause (mandatory).
* Predicate clause (optional).
* Aggregates clause (mandatory).

Payload examples (`predicate` and `searchSpan` are omitted for clarity):

Request Body:

                }
            ]
        }
    }]
}
```

Response Body:
```json
{
    "aggregates": [{
        "dimension": ["co2", "temp"],
        "aggregate": {
            "dimension": [

        }
    }]
}
```

For numeric histogram, bucket boundaries are aligned to one of 10^n, 2x10^n or 5x10^n values.

If no measure expressions are specified and the list of events is empty, the response will be empty.
If measures are present, the response contains a single record with `null` dimension value, 0 value for count and `null` value for other kinds of measures.

## Get Environment Aggregates Streamed API

`GET wss://<environmentFqdn>/aggregates?api-version=<apiVersion>`

The Get Environment Aggregates API groups events by given property with optionally measuring values of other properties.

This API use Web Sockets to do streaming and return partial results.
It always returns a replacement (snapshot) of all the values.
Previous packet can be discarded by the client.

Input payload structure:
* Search span clause (mandatory).
* Predicate clause (optional).
* Aggregates clause (mandatory).

Payload examples (`predicate` and `searchSpan` are omitted for clarity):

                ]
            ]
        }
    }],
    "percentCompleted" : 100.0
}
```

For numeric histogram, bucket boundaries are aligned to one of 10^n, 2x10^n or 5x10^n values.

If no measure expressions are specified and the list of events is empty, the response will be empty.
If measures are present, the response contains a single record with `null` dimension value, 0 value for count and `null` value for other kinds of measures.

## Property Not Found Behavior

For properties referenced in the query, either as part of predicates or part of aggregates (measures), by default, the query tries to resolve the property in the global search span of the environment. If the property is found, then query succeeds else it fails. 

Users can however modify this behavior to treat properties as existing but with `null` values if they are not present in the environment. This can be done by setting the optional request header `x-ms-property-not-found-behavior with` value `UseNull`.

Possible values for the request header are `UseNull` or `ThrowError` (Default). When `UseNull` is set, the query succeeds despite properties not exisiting and the response will contain warnings which will contain the properties that are not found.

## Limits

The following limits are applied during query execution to fairly utilize resources among multiple environments and users:

| Applicable APIs | Limit name | Limit value | SKUs affected | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| All | Max request size | 32 KB | S1, S2 |  |

## Reporting Unresolved Properties

Property references can be specified for predicate, dimension, and measure expressions.
If a property with a specific name and type does not exist for a given search span, an attempt is made to resolve a property over a global time span.
An error or warning might be emitted depending on the success of resolution:
* If a property exists in the environment over a global time span, it is resolved appropriately and a warning is emitted to notify that the value of this property is `null` for a given search span.
* If a property does not exist in the environment, an error is emitted and query execution fails.

## Error Responses

If query execution fails, the JSON response payload contains an error response with the following structure:
```json
{
    "error" : {
        "code" : "...",
        "message" : "...",
        "innerError" : {  
            "code" : "...",
            "message" : "...",
        }
    }
}
```

Here, `innerError` is optional. In addition to basic errors like malformed request, the following errors are returned:

| Http status code | Error code | Example of error message | Possible inner error codes |

| 408 | RequestTimeout | Request timed out after '30' second(s). | - |
| 503 | TooManyRequests | Concurrent request count of '10' exceeded for environment '95880732-01b9-44ea-8d2d-4d764dfe1904'. | EnvRequestLimitExceeded |

## Warnings

A query API response may contain a list of warnings as `"warnings"` entry under the root of the HTTP response or WebSocket response message.
Currently warnings are generated if property is not found for a given search span but is found in an environment for global time span. It is also generated when the header `x-ms-property-not-found-behavior` is set to `UseNull` and a property that is refernced does not exist even in the global search span.

Each warning object may contain the following fields:

| Field name | Field type | Notes |
|--|--|--|
| code | String | One of predefined warning codes |
| message | String | Detailed warning message |
| target | String | Dot-separated JSON path to the JSON input payload entry causing the warning |
| warningDetails | Dictionary | Optional. Additional warning details, for example, the position in predicate string. |

Example of warnings for predicate, predicate string within predicate, dimension, and measure:
```json
"warnings": [
    {
        "code": "PropertyNotFound",
        "message": "Predicate property 'X' of type 'String' is not found in local search span.",
        "target": "predicate.and[0].eq.left.property.name"
    },
    {
        "code": "PropertyNotFound",
        "message": "Predicate string property 'X' is not found in local search span.",
        "target": "predicate.and[1].predicateString",
        "warningDetails":
        {
            "startPos": 1,
            "endPos": 2,
            "line": 1,
            "col": 1
        }
    },
    {
        "code": "PropertyNotFound",
        "message": "Dimension property 'X' of type 'String' is not found in local search span.",
        "target": "aggregates.dimension.uniqueValues.input.property"
    },
    {
        "code": "PropertyNotFound",
        "message": "Measure property 'X' of type 'String' is not found in local search span.",
        "target": "aggregates.aggregates.measures[0].min.input.property"
    }
]
```
