# Azure Time Series Insights general availability (GA) APIs

Time Series Insights enables you to query and view the data in your Time Series Insights environments three ways. You can query with the Time Series Insights explorer, create a query on behalf of an environment to be deployed using a custom URL, or you can create a custom application using the [Time Series Insights query API](ga-query-api.md) to achieve scenarios such as:

- Leverage Time Series Insights scalable platform for ad-hoc analysis on the fly
- Time series interval chunking
- Low latency time series data storage
- Leverage best-in-class Azure security and identity management
- Perform repeated operations with reliability and ease

For information about how to use the Time Series Insights Query API for custom applications, see [Azure Time Series Insights query API](ga-query-api.md).

For information about supported query constructs and input formats, see [Azure Time Series Insights Query Syntax](ga-query-syntax.md).
