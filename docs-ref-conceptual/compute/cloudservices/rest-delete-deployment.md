## Remarks  
 If the deployment that is being deleted is using a reserved IP address, the address continues to be reserved for your subscription. The unused reserved IP address continues to incur charges.  To delete the reserved IP address if you donâ€™t need it anymore, use [Delete Reserved IP Address](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/b5830165-aa90-4676-9fa8-1aab4d9de5e1).
