# List Cloud Services
The `List Cloud Services` operation lists the cloud services that are available under the specified subscription.  
  
## Request  
 The `List Cloud Services` request may be specified as follows. Replace `<subscription-id>` with your subscription ID.  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|GET|`https://management.core.windows.net/<subscription-id>/services/hostedservices`|  
  
### URI Parameters  
 None.  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes the request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. This header should be set to `2009-10-01` or higher.|  
|`x-ms-continuation-token`|Optional. Specifies a continuation token that enables you to get the remainder of the response when there are more cloud services to list than can be returned in the allotted time. The value of this token is returned in the header of a previous response and will only be returned if additional cloud services need to be listed.|  
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code, a set of response headers, and a response body.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers.  
  
|Response Header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|Specifies a value that uniquely identifies a request made against the management service.|  
|`x-ms-continuation-token`|Specifies a continuation token that enables you to get the remainder of the response when there are more cloud services to list than can be returned in the allotted time. If a large number of cloud services exist in the subscription, not all of them can be listed in a single response. You can use the token in this header in subsequent operation requests until all cloud services are returned.|  
  
### Response Body  
 The format of the response body is as follows:  
  
```

 You can see the cloud services that exist in your subscription by looking in the Cloud Services section of the Management Portal. You can also get a list of cloud services by using the [Get-AzureService](/powershell/module/servicemanagement/azure.service/get-azureservice?view=azuresmps-4.0.0&preserveview=true) cmdlet.
