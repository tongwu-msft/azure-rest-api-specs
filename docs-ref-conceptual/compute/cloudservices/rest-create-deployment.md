# Create Deployment
The `Create Deployment` asynchronous operation uploads a new service package and creates a new deployment in the staging or production environments.  
  
 Before you can run this operation, you must complete the following tasks:  
  
-   Create a subscription and obtain the subscription identifier.  You can obtain the subscription identifier on the Settings page of the Management Portal.  
  
-   Create and upload a management certificate to authorize the operation.  
  
-   Create a cloud service.  
  
-   Decide whether the application should be deployed in staging or production.  
  
## Request  
 The `Create Deployment` request is specified as follows. Replace `<subscription-id>` with your subscription ID, `<cloudservice-name>` with the name of the cloud service, and `<deployment-slot>` with `staging` or `production`.

```  
  
 The following table describes the elements in the request body.  
  
|Element name|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|Name|Required. Specifies the name of the deployment.|  
|PackageUrl|Required. Specifies a URL that refers to the location of the service package in the Blob service. The service package can be located either in a storage account beneath the same subscription or a Shared Access Signature (SAS) URI from any storage account.|  
|Configuration|Required. Specifies the base-64 encoded service configuration file for the deployment.|  
|Label|Required. Specifies an identifier for the deployment that is base-64 encoded. The identifier can be up to 100 characters in length. It is recommended that the label be unique within the subscription. The label can be used for your tracking purposes.|  
|StartDeployment|Optional. Indicates whether to start the deployment immediately after it is created. The default value is `false`.<br /><br /> If `false`, the service model is still deployed, but the code is not run immediately. Instead, the service is `Suspended` until you call [Update Deployment Status](rest-update-deployment-status.md) and set the status to `Running`, at which time the service will be started. A deployed service still incurs charges, even if it is suspended.<br /><br /> The `StartDeployment` element is only available using version 2010-04-01 or higher.|  
|TreatWarningsAsError|Optional. Indicates whether to treat package validation warnings as errors. The default value is `false`. If set to `true`, the `Created Deployment` operation fails if there are validation warnings on the service package.<br /><br /> The `TreatWarningsAsError` element is only available using version 2011-04-01 or higher.|  
|Name|Optional. Specifies the name of an extended deployment property. Each extended property must have both a defined name and value. You can have a maximum of 25 extended property name and value pairs.<br /><br /> The maximum length of the Name element is 64 characters, only alphanumeric characters and underscores are valid in the Name, and the name must start with a letter.<br /><br /> The `Name` element is only available using version 2012-03-01 or higher.|  
|Value|Optional. Specifies the value of an extended cloud service property. Each extended property must have both a defined name and value. You can have a maximum of 25 extended property name and value pairs, and each extended property value has a maximum length of 255 characters.<br /><br /> The `Value` element is only available using version 2012-03-01 or higher.|  
|[ExtensionConfiguration](rest-create-deployment.md#bk_extensionconfig)|Optional. Specifies an extension that is added to the cloud service. In Azure, a process can run as an extension of a cloud service. You must add an extension to the cloud service by using [Add Extension](rest-add-extension.md) before it can be added to the deployment.<br /><br /> The `ExtensionConfiguration` element is only available using version 2013-03-01 or higher.|  
  
##  <a name="bk_extensionconfig"></a> ExtensionConfiguration  
 Specifies an extension that is added to the cloud service.

This element only applies to JSON configured extensions.<br /><br /> Possible values are:<br /><br /> -   `Enable`<br />-   `Disable`<br />-   `Uninstall`<br /><br /> The default value is `Enable`.<br /><br /> The `State` element is only available using version 2014-06-01 or higher.|  
  
##  <a name="bk_namedroles"></a> NamedRoles  
 Specifies a list of extensions that are applied to specific roles in a deployment.  
  
|Element name|Description|  
|------------------|-----------------|  
|Role|Required. Specifies a specific role to which the extension is added.|  
|RoleName|Required. Specifies the name of the role.|
