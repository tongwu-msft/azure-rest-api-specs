## Request  
 The `Reimage Role Instance` request may be specified as follows. Replace `<subscription-id>` with the subscription ID, `<cloudservice-name>` with the name of the cloud service, `<deployment-slot>` with `staging` or `production`, or `<deployment-name>` with the name of the deployment. Replace `<role-instance-name>` with the name of the role instance.

|Response Header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|A value that uniquely identifies a request made against the management service. For an asynchronous operation, you can call [Get Operation Status](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/1215ece5-cbef-4a85-a3db-ab6c20c2c6df) with the value of the header to determine whether the operation is complete, has failed, or is still in progress.|  
  
### Response Body  
 None.  
  
## Remarks  
 When the role instance is reimaged, the instance is taken offline and a fresh guest operating system image is applied. The role instance is then brought back online. An attempt is made to maintain data in any local storage resources when the role is reimaged; however, in case of a transient hardware failure, the local storage resource may be lost. If your application requires that this data be persisted, it is recommended that you write it to a durable data source, such as an Azure drive. Any data that is written to a local directory other than that defined by the local storage resource will be lost when the role is reimaged.
