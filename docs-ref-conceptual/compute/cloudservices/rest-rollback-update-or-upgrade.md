|||  
|-|-|  
|Element Name|Description|

The deployment status can be detected by calling the [Get Deployment](rest-get-deployment.md) operation or [Get Cloud Service Properties](rest-get-cloud-service-properties.md) operation and inspecting the **RollbackAllowed** element. If the value returned is **true** a rollback can be performed.
