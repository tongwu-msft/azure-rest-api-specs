Replace `<role-instance-name>` with the name of your role instance.

### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers.  
  
|Response Header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|A value that uniquely identifies a request made against the management service. For an asynchronous operation, you can call [Get Operation Status](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/1215ece5-cbef-4a85-a3db-ab6c20c2c6df) with the value of the header to determine whether the operation is complete, has failed, or is still in progress.|  
  
### Response Body  
 None.  
  
## Remarks  
 When you reboot a role instance, the instance is taken offline, the underlying operating system is restarted for that instance, and the instance is brought back online. Any data that is written to the local disk is persisted across reboots. Any data that is in-memory is lost.
