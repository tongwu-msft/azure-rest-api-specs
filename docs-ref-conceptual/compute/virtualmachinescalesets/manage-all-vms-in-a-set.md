# Manage all VMs in a set
Manage the virtual machines in a Virtual Machine Scale Set. You can use this task to start, restart, stop, delete, or upgrade a virtual machine in the scale set.

```    
{    
  "instanceIds" : [ "0","1","2","3"... ]     
}    
    
```    
    
You can also use an asterisk (*) to apply the action to all virtual machines in the scale set.    
    
```    
{    
  "instanceIds" : [ "*" ]     
}    
```    
    
|Element name|Required|Type|Description|    
|------------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|    
|instanceIds|No|Collection|Specifies a list of instance identifiers for the virtual machines on which the action should be performed. You must provide at least one identifier. To find the identifier of a virtual machine, see [List all VMs in a set](list-all-vm-instance-views-in-a-set.md).|    
    
## Response    

Status code: 200 (OK).    
    
## Remarks    

If you are deleting a virtual machine, the persistent disk blobs associated with the machine are also deleted. If you use the asterisk (*) with the delete action and change the capacity to 0, autoscale will not function.
