# Service Map REST API Reference

Service Map automatically discovers application components on Windows and Linux systems and maps the communication between services. It allows you to view your servers as you think of them â€“ as interconnected systems that deliver critical services.  Service Map shows connections between servers, processes, and ports across any TCP-connected architecture with no configuration required other than installation of an agent.

The Service Map REST API allows you to query Service Map dependency data from any client that can call a REST API.
