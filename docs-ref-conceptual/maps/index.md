# Azure IoT Maps Functional API

Azure Maps (AzMaps) is a portfolio of geospatial services. The current geospatial services include Maps, Search, Routing, 
Traffic, and Time Zones. These services allow a developer to use familiar tools to integrate location information into 
their Azure solutions. Azure Maps provides both web and mobile developers powerful geospatial capabilities supported by 
fresh mapping data.
