# Network Watcher REST API

Network Watcher is the resource that exposes networking diagnostic APIs in Azure. Before any calls can be made into the APIs below, you must create a Network Watcher resource. Network Watcher is a regional resource. You must create one Network Watcher resource per subscription per region. The simplest way to create a Network Watcher is from within the portal, but you can also manually create and manage your Network Watcher resources using the REST API below.
