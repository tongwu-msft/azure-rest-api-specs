# Azure Arc Kubernetes Configuration

GitOps is the practice of declaring the desired state of Kubernetes cluster configurations (deployments, namespaces, etc.) in a Git repository.  GitOps Configurations enable you to declare these in AKS and Arc K8s clusters.  Extensions allow you to add extensions (aka Add-ons) to your K8s clusters.
