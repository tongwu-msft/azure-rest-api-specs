# Program
A Program enables you to control the publishing and storage of segments in a live stream. Programs can run concurrently. This allows you to publish and archive different parts of the event as needed.  
  
 You can specify the number of hours you want to retain the recorded content for the program by setting the `ArchiveWindowLength` property (up to 25 hours). Clients can seek through the archived content for the specified number of hours. If the program runs longer than the specified ArchiveWindowLength, the older content is removed. For more information, see the `ArchiveWindowLength` documentation below.  
  
 This topic gives an overview of the `Program` entity and also demonstrates how to execute various operations with the Media Services REST API.

> When accessing entities in Media Services, you must set specific header fields and values in your HTTP requests. <br/>For more information, see [Setup for Media Services REST API Development](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/media-services-rest-how-to-use) and [Connecting to Media Services with the Media Services REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/media-services-use-aad-auth-to-access-ams-api).  

  
##  <a name="program_properties"></a> Program Entity Properties  
 The Program entity contains the following properties.  
  
|Property|Type|Description|  
|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|`Id`<br /><br /> Read-only. Set by Media Services.|Edm.String|The Program ID, assigned upon creation. The format is: nb:pgid:UUID:\<GUID>.|  
|`Name`|Edm.String|The name of the Program. The maximum length is 256 characters and can consist of any English characters and numbers, including '-' and ' ' as long as it starts and ends with alphanumeric characters.|  
|`AssetId`|Edm.String|The Asset ID to be used for Program processing. The property can only be updated when the Program is in the **Stopped** state.<br /><br /> An asset cannot be deleted if it is used by a program. You can delete an asset after deleting the program that uses it.|  
|`Created`<br /><br /> Read-only. Set by Media Services.|Edm.DateTime|A UTC date/time value that indicates the time of creation.|  
|`Description`|Edm.String|User provided description. The maximum length is 256 characters.|  
|`ArchiveWindowLength`<br /><br /> Required.|Edm.Time|The number of hours you want to retain the recorded content for the program. This value can be set from a minimum of 5 minutes to a maximum of 25 hours. This also dictates the maximum amount of time clients can seek back in time from the current live position. Programs can run over the specified amount of time, but content that falls behind the window length is continuously discarded. This value of this property also determines how long the client manifests can grow.<br /><br /> To delete archived content, stop and delete the program and then delete the asset associated with the program.|  
|`LastModified`<br /><br /> Read-only. Set by Media Services.|Edm.DateTime|The date and time of the last modification.|  
|`ManifestName`|Edm.String|The manifest file name, without extension. This property can be updated only when the Program is in the **Stopped** state.|  
|`State`<br /><br /> Read-only. Set by Media Services.|Edm.String|Gets the current state. Possible values include:<br /><br /> -   Stopped. After creating a Program, it is in the **Stopped** state. In this state, the Program properties can be updated, but streaming is not allowed. The Program can be started, updated, or deleted from this state.<br />-   Starting. Program is being started. No updates or streaming is allowed during this state.<br />-   Running. Program is capable of processing and archiving live streams.<br />-   Stopping. Program is being stopped. No updates or streaming is allowed during this state.|  
|`ChannelId`<br /><br /> Read-only. Set by Media Services.|Edm.String|The ID of the Program's parent Channel.|  
|`Channel`|[Channel](../operations/channel.md)|The Program's parent channel specified by the **ChannelId**.|
