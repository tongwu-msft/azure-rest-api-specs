# Channel
In Azure Media Services (AMS), the Channel entity represents a pipeline for processing live streaming content. A Channel receives live input streams in one of two ways:  
  
-   An on-premises live encoder sends multi-bitrate `RTMP` or `Smooth Streaming` (Fragmented MP4) to the Channel. You can use the following live encoders that output multi-bitrate Smooth Streaming: MediaExcel, Imagine Communications, Ateme, Envivio, Cisco and Elemental. The following live encoders output RTMP: Adobe Flash Live Encoder, Haivision, Telestream Wirecast, Teradek and Tricaster encoders. The ingested streams pass through Channels without any further processing. When requested, Media Services delivers the stream to customers.  
  
-   A single bitrate stream (in one of the following formats: `RTP` (MPEG-TS), `RTMP`, or `Smooth Streaming` (Fragmented MP4)) is sent to the `Channel` that is enabled to perform live encoding with Media Services. The `Channel` then performs live encoding of the incoming single bitrate stream to a multi-bitrate (adaptive) video stream. When requested, Media Services delivers the stream to customers.  
  
 Starting with the Media Services 2.10 release, when you create a Channel, you can specify in which way you want for your channel to receive the input stream and whether or not you want for the channel to perform live encoding of your stream. You have two options:  
  
-   `None` – Specify this value, if you plan to use an on-premises live encoder which will output multi-bitrate stream. In this case, the incoming stream passed through to the output without any encoding. This is the behavior of a Channel prior to 2.10 release. For more detailed information about working with channels of this type, see [Working with Channels that Receive Multi-bitrate Live Stream from On-premises Encoders](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/media-services-manage-channels-overview/).  
  
-   `Standard` – If you plan to use Media Services to encode your single bitrate live stream to multi-bitrate stream, choose this value.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Be aware that there is a billing impact for live encoding and you should remember that leaving a live encoding channel in the "Running" state will incur billing charges.  It is recommended that you immediately stop your running channels after your live streaming event is complete to avoid extra hourly charges. For more information, see [Working with Channels that are Enabled to Perform Live Encoding with Azure Media Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/media-services-manage-live-encoder-enabled-channels/).

## Channel Entity  
 The `Channel` entity contains the following properties.  
  
|Property|Type|Description|  
|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|`Id`<br /><br /> Read-only. Set by Media Services.|Edm.String|The Channel ID, assigned upon creation. The format is:<br /><br /> nb:chid:UUID:\<GUID>.|  
|`Name`|Edm.String|The Channel name.<br /><br /> 1.  Must be unique within your Media Services account.<br />2.  Maximum length = 32 characters.<br />3.  Cannot contain spaces.<br />4.  Hyphens and alphanumeric characters only.<br />5.  Cannot begin or end with a hyphen.|  
|`Created`<br /><br /> Read-only. Set by Media Services.|Edm.DateTime|A UTC date/time value that indicates the time of creation.|  
|`Description`|Edm.String|User provided description. The maximum length is 256 characters.|  
|`LastModified`<br /><br /> Read-only. Set by Media Services.|Edm.DateTime|The date and time of the last update to the channel.|  
|`State`<br /><br /> Read-only. Set by Media Services.|Edm.String|The current state of channel. Possible values include:<br /><br /> -   Stopped. This is the initial state of the Channel after its creation. In this state, the Channel properties can be updated but streaming is not allowed.<br />-   Starting. Channel is being started. No updates or streaming is allowed during this state. If an error occurs, the Channel returns to the **Stopped** state.<br />-   Running. The Channel is capable of processing live streams.<br />-   Stopping. The channel is being stopped. No updates or streaming is allowed during this state.<br />-   Deleting. The Channel is being deleted. No updates or streaming is allowed during this state.|  
|`Input`|[ChannelInput ComplexType](#ChannelInput)|Channel input (ingest) settings.|  
|`Output`|[ChannelOutput ComplexType](#ChannelOutput)|Channel output settings.|  
|`Preview`|[ChannelPreview ComplexType](#ChannelPreview)|Channel preview settings.|  
|`CrossSiteAccessPolicies`|[CrossSiteAccessPolicies](../operations/crosssiteaccesspolicies.md)|Cross site access policies.|  
|`Programs`<br /><br /> Read-only. Set by Media Services.|A collection of [Program](../operations/program.md)s.|A reference to the collection of programs associated with the channel.|  
|`EncodingType`|Edm.String|`Optional`. Describes the configuration of the Channel. Allowed values are:<br /><br /> -   `None` – This is the default value. When you select this value, the incoming stream passed through to the output without any encoding (this is the behavior of a Channel prior to 2.10 release).<br />-   `Standard` – The incoming single bitrate stream is sent to the Channel and transcoded into a multi-bitrate stream using [System presets](#SystemPreset)|  
|`Encoding`|[Encoding ComplexType](#encoding)|Azure live encoder settings.|  
|`Slate`|[Slate](#slate)|This setting is supported only when the `Encoding Type` of the Channel is set to `Standard`.<br /><br /> The live encoder within the Channel can be signaled to switch to a slate image. It can also be signaled to end an on-going slate.<br /><br /> The live encoder can be configured to switch to a slate image and mask the incoming video signal in certain situations – for example, during an ad break. If such a slate is not configured, input video is not masked during that ad break.|  
  
###  <a name="ChannelInput"></a> ChannelInput ComplexType  
  
|Name|Type|Description|  
|----------|----------|-----------------|  
|`KeyFrameInterval`|Edm.Time|This value is ignored if `EncoderType` is set to `Standard`.<br /><br /> When using an on-premises live encoder to generate multi-bitrate stream, the keyf rame interval specifies GOP duration (as used by that external encoder). Once this incoming stream is received by the Channel, you can then deliver your live stream to client playback applications in any of the following formats: Smooth Streaming, DASH and HLS. When doing live streaming, HLS is always packaged dynamically. By default, Media Services automatically calculates HLS segment packaging ratio (fragments per segment) based on the key frame interval, also referred to as Group of Pictures – GOP, that is received from the live encoder.|  
|`StreamingProtocol`<br /><br /> Read-only.|Edm.String|After you set the encoder type, you can set an ingest protocol.<br /><br /> If the `Encoder Type` is set to `None`, valid options are:<br /><br /> -   Multi-bitrate Fragmented MP4 (Smooth Streaming)<br />-   Multi-bitrate RTMP<br /><br /> When your `Encoder Type` is set to `None`, it is valid, but undesirable, for a single bitrate RTMP or Smooth Streaming live stream to be sent. The channel does not do any processing with the stream, so it will pass through, but the client applications will get a single bitrate stream.<br /><br /> If the `Encoder Type` is set to `Standard`, valid options are:<br /><br /> 1.  Single bitrate Fragmented MP4 (Smooth Streaming)<br />2.  Single bitrate RTMP<br />3.  RTP (MPEG-TS): MPEG-2 Transport Stream over RTP.|  
|`AccessControl`|ChannelInputAccessControl ComplexType|Channel input access control settings.|  
|`Endpoints`<br /><br /> Read-only.|[ChannelEndpoint ComplexType](#ChannelEndpoint)|Channel input endpoints.<br /><br /> A Channel provides input endpoints (ingest URLs) that you then use to ingest your live stream. The channel receives live input streams and makes the output streams available for streaming through one or more streaming endpoints.|

|Name|Type|Description|  
|----------|----------|-----------------|  
|`Index`|Edm.Int1|A zero-based index that specifies which input video stream should be processed by the live encoder within the Channel. This setting applies only if ingest streaming protocol is RTP (MPEG-TS).<br /><br /> Default value is zero. It is recommended to send in a single program transport stream (SPTS). If the input stream contains multiple programs, the live encoder parses the Program Map Table (PMT) in the input, identifies the inputs that have a stream type name of MPEG-2 Video or H.264, and arranges them in the order specified in the PMT. The zero-based index is then used to pick up the n-th entry in that arrangement.|  
|`Name`|Edm.String|`Optional`. Descriptive tag for this input video stream.|  
  
 For more detailed information about this type and its properties, see [Overview of Channels that are enabled for Live Encoding](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/media-services-manage-live-encoder-enabled-channels/).  
  
###  <a name="AudioStreams"></a> AudioStreams  
 Describes the input audio streams. If this field is not specified, the default values specified apply. This setting is allowed only if the input streaming protocol is set to RTP (MPEG-TS).  
  
|Name|Type|Description|  
|----------|----------|-----------------|  
|`Index`|Edm.Int16|It is recommended to send in a single program transport stream (SPTS). If the input stream contains multiple programs, the live encoder within the Channel parses the Program Map Table (PMT) in the input, identifies the inputs that have a stream type name of MPEG-2 AAC ADTS or AC-3 System-A or AC-3 System-B or MPEG-2 Private PES or MPEG-1 Audio or MPEG-2 Audio, and arranges them in the order specified in the PMT.

|`Language`|Edm.String|`Optional`. The language identifier of the audio stream, conforming to ISO 639-2, such as ENG. If not present, the default is UND (undefined).<br /><br /> There can be up to 8 audio stream sets specified if the input to the Channel is MPEG-2 TS over RTP. However, there can be no two entries with the same value of Index.|  
  
 There can be up to 8 {Index, Name, Language} sets specified if the input to the encoder is MPEG-2 TS over RTP. However, there can be no two entries with the same value of Index. If the input to the encoder is RTMP or HTTP (Smooth Streaming), then there can only be one audio stream in the input.  
  
###  <a name="slate"></a> Slate  
 This setting is supported only when the `Encoding Type` of the Channel is set to `Standard`.  
  
 The live encoder within the Channel can be signaled to switch to a slate image. It can also be signaled to end an on-going slate.  
  
 The live encoder can be configured to switch to a slate image and mask the incoming video signal in certain situations – for example, during an ad break. If such a slate is not configured, input video is not masked during that ad break.  
  
|Name|Type|Description|  
|----------|----------|-----------------|  
|`InsertSlateOnAdMarker`|Edm.Bool|When set to True, this setting configures the live encoder to insert a slate image during an ad break. The default value is true.|  
|`DefaultSlateAssetId`|Edm.String|`Optional`. Specifies the Asset Id of the Media Services Asset which contains the slate image. Default is null.<br /><br /> Before creating the Channel, the slate image, of 1920x1080 maximum resolution, in JPEG format, and at most 3 Mbytes in size, should be uploaded as a dedicated asset (no other files should be in this asset). The file name should have a *.jpg extension, and this AssetFile should be marked as the primary file for that asset. This Asset cannot be storage encr2ypted.<br /><br /> If the default slate Asset Id is not specified, and insert slate on ad marker is set to true, a default Azure Media Services image will be used to mask the input stream.|
