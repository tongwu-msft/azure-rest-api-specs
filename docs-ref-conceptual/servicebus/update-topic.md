# Update Topic
Updates a topic. The updated descriptor is sent in the request body. The API updates the topic entries in the FE/BE entries.  
  
## Request  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|PUT|https://management.core.windows.net/{subscription ID}/services/ServiceBus/Namespaces/{Namespace}/Topics/{Topic Path}|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|x-ms-version|**2012-03-01**|  
|If-Match|*|  
  
 Note that the request also requires a client certificate. This certificate must match the certificate you uploaded for that particular subscription.  
  
### Request Body  
 The following table describes the key elements of the request body. These are the only properties that you can update. The body must include the full topic description, even if you are only changing one property. The recommended flow is as follows:  
  
1.  Get topic description.  
  
2.  Update the required elements.  
  
3.  Pass in the updated description.  
  
|Property Name|Type|Description|  
|-------------------|----------|-----------------|    
|**DefaultMessageTimeToLive**|XML Datetime|Based on whether dead lettering is enabled, if a message has been stored in the topic for more than the specified time, it is automatically moved to the dead-letter queue or deleted. This value is overwritten by a TTL specified on the message if the message TTL is smaller than the TTL set on the topic. This value is immutable after the topic has been created:<br /><br /> -   Range: 1 second – 14 days.<br /><br /> -   Default: 14 days.|  
|**DuplicateDetectionHistoryTimeWindow**|Time Span|A property that specifies the time span during which Service Bus detects message duplication.<br /><br /> -   Range: 1 second – 7 days.<br /><br /> -   Default: 10 minutes.|
