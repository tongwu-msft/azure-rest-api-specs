# Common parameters and headers: Service Bus topic subscriptions
  
 The following information is common to all tasks that you might do related to Service Bus subscriptions:  
  
-   Replace {subscriptionId} with your subscription identifier in the URI.  
  
-   Replace {api-version} with “2014-09-01” in the URI.  
  
-   Set the Content-Type header to **application/json**.  
  
-   Set the Authorization header to a JSON Web Token that you obtain from Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Authenticating Azure Resource Manager requests](/rest/api/resources).  
  
-   Replace {resourceGroupName} with the resource group name within your subscriptionId. For more information, see [Manage Azure Resource Manager resource groups by using the Azure portal](/azure/azure-resource-manager/manage-resource-groups-portal).  
  
-   Replace {namespaceName} with the name of the namespace you created on the portal.  
  
-   Replace {queueName} with the name of the queue you created on the portal.  
  
-   Replace {topicName} with the name of the topic you created on the portal.  
  
-   Replace {subscriptionName} with the name of the topic subscription you created on the portal.  
  
-   Replace {eventhubName} with the name of the Event hub you created on the portal. This name must be unique within a Service Bus namespace; there can be no other queue, topic, or Event hub with the same name in the same namespace.  
  
-   Replace {ConsumerGroupName} with the name of the consumer group you created on the portal.
