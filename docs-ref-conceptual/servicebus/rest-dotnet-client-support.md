# REST vs. .NET Client Support
## Version and server overview  
 Following Azure guidelines, REST APIs now support versioning. By default, passing no version indicates current service behavior. Any changes in existing REST APIs require providing an `api-version` value as the query string.  
  
 The following table lists the REST API versions for each Service Bus release.  
  
|Version|  
|-------------|  
|“2012-03”|  
|“2012-08”|  
|“2013-04”|  
|“2013-07”|  
|“2013-08”|  
|“2013-10”|  
|“2014-01”|  
|“2015-01”|
