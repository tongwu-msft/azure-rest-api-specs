# Create Queue
Creates a new queue. Once created, the queue resource manifest is immutable. This operation is idempotent. Repeating the create call after a queue with same name has been created successfully, results in a 409 Conflict error message.  
  
## Request  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|PUT|https://management.core.windows.net/{subscription ID}/services/ServiceBus/Namespaces/{Namespace}/Queues/{Queue Path}|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|Content-Type|application/xml;type=entry;charset=utf-8|  
|x-ms-version|**2012-03-01**|  
  
 Note that the request also requires a client certificate. This certificate must match the certificate you uploaded for that particular subscription.  
  
### Request Body  
 The following table describes the key elements of the request body:  
  
|Property Name|Type|Required|Description|  
|-------------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|  
||||  
|**MaxQueueSizeInMegaBytes**|Unsigned Integer|Required|This parameter specifies the maximum queue size in megabytes. Any attempt to enqueue a message that causes the queue to exceed this value will fail. Only user content counts towards this value. Settable at queue creation time and at runtime:<br /><br /> -   Range: 1–5*1024.<br /><br /> -   Default: 1\*1024.|  
|**QueueSizeinBytes**|Unsigned Integer|Read only. Not required at creation.|This parameter reflects the actual bytes that messages in the queue currently occupy toward the queue’s quota.<br /><br /> Range: 0 –**MaxTopicSizeinMegaBytes**|  
|**QueueDepth**|Unsigned Integer|Read-only. Not required at creation.|This parameter shows the number of messages currently in the queue.|  
|**DefaultMessageTimeToLive**|XML Datetime|Optional, default is 14 days.|Based on whether dead lettering is enabled, if a message has been stored in the queue for more than the specified time, it is automatically moved to the dead-letter queue or deleted. This value is overwritten by a TTL specified on the message if the message TTL is smaller than the TTL set on the queue. This value is immutable after the queue has been created:<br /><br /> -   Range: 1 second – 14 days.<br /><br /> -   Default: 14 days.|  
|**LockDuration**|XML Datetime|Optional, default is 30 seconds.|This setting determines the amount of time in seconds for which a message should be locked for processing by a receiver. After this period, the message is unlocked and available for consumption by the next receiver. Settable only at queue creation time:<br /><br /> -   Range: 0–5 min. 0 means that the message is not locked.<br /><br /> -   Default: 30 seconds.|  
|**RequiresSession**|Boolean|Optional|Settable only at queue creation time. If set to `true`, the queue will be session aware and only the `SessionReceiver` is supported. Session-aware queues are not supported through REST.<br /><br /> -   Default: False.|  
|**RequiresDuplicateDetection**|Boolean|Optional|Settable only at queue creation time.<br /><br /> -   Default for durable queue: **false**.|  
|**EnableDeadLetteringOnMessageExpiration**|Boolean|Optional|Settable only at queue creation time.<br /><br /> -   Default: **false**.<br /><br /> This field determines how Service Bus handles a message with an expired TTL. If **true** and a message expires, Service Bus moves the message from the queue into the queue’s dead-letter subqueue. If it is **false**, the message is permanently deleted from the queue.|  
|**DuplicateDetectionHistoryTimeWindow**|Time Span|Optional.|A property that specifies the time span during which Service Bus detects message duplication.<br /><br /> -   Range: 1 second–7 days.<br /><br /> -   Default: 10 minutes.|  
|**Status**|String|Read-only. Not required at creation.|Can be one of the following values:<br /><br /> -   **Creating**: when still in creation phase.<br />-   **Active**: by default after creation, or when user activates it after last time suspended.<br />-   **Suspended**: when user updates the entity to be suspended.|
