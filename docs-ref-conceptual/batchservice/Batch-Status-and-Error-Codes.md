# Batch Status and Error Codes
  REST API operations for the Batch service return standard HTTP status codes, as defined in the [HTTP/1.1 Status Code Definitions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=133333).

 API operations may also return additional error information to provide the developer with more information about the error. For example, the following error response indicates that a query parameter specified on the request URI was invalid, and provides additional information about the invalid parameterâ€™s name and value and the reason for the error.

```json
{
  "code": "InvalidQueryParameterValue",
  "message": {
      "lang": "en-us",
      "value": "Value for one of the query parameters specified in the request URI is invalid"
  },
  "values": [{
      "key": "QueryParameterName",
      "value": "state"
  }, {
      "key": "QueryParameterValue",
      "value": "deleted"
  }, {
      "key": "Reason",
      "value": "invalid state"
  }]
}
```

 The following sections provide lists of error codes for the Batch service:

-   [Common REST API Error Codes](#bk_ComRESTAPIErrCodes)

-   [Batch Service Error Codes](#bk_batchsererrcode)

-   [Job/Task Scheduling Error Codes](#BKMK_JobTaskError)

##  <a name="BKMK_JobTaskError"></a> Job/Task Scheduling Error Codes
 If the Batch service encounters an error when starting a task on a node, it marks the task as completed. The error information is returned within a `failureInfo` element in the response body of [List the files associated with a task](../batchservice/list-the-files-associated-with-a-task.md) and [Get information about a task](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-task.md) APIs.

 Similarly, if the Batch service encounters an error while starting the job, it marks the job as completed. This scheduling error information is returned within a `schedulingError` element in the response body of [Get information about a job in Batch](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-job-in-batch.md) APIs.

 The following table provides the list of categories for task scheduling errors.

|Category|Description|
|--------------|-----------------|
|UserError|Errors in the task specification provided by the user.|
|ServerError|Errors encountered by the Batch service that prevent it from scheduling the task.|

 Below is a sample pre-processing error returned by the Batch service.

```json
{
  "preProcessingError": {
    "category": "UserError",
    "code": "BlobNotFound",
    "message": "The specified blob does not exist.",
    "values": {
      "name": "FilePath",
      "value": "myfile.txt"
    }
