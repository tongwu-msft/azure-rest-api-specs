# Job Schedules
In addition to creating jobs directly, you can run recurring jobs using a job schedule. A job schedule specifies when to run jobs, and includes a specification that is used to create each job. You can do the following with job schedules:  
  
- [Add a job schedule to an account](../batchservice/add-a-job-schedule-to-an-account.md)  
  
- [Delete a job schedule from an account](../batchservice/delete-a-job-schedule-from-an-account.md)  
  
- [Disable a job schedule](../batchservice/disable-a-job-schedule.md)  
  
- [Enable a job schedule](../batchservice/enable-a-job-schedule.md)  
  
- [Get information about a job schedule](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-job-schedule.md)  
  
- [List the job schedules in an account](../batchservice/list-the-job-schedules-in-an-account.md)  
  
- [List the jobs associated with a job schedule](../batchservice/list-the-jobs-associated-with-a-job-schedule.md)  
  
- [Terminate a job schedule](../batchservice/terminate-a-job-schedule.md)  
  
- [Update the properties of a job schedule](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-job-schedule.md)
