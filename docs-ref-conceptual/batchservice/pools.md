# Pools
  A pool is a container for compute nodes.  You can configure a pool to have a specific size, or to scale automatically depending on workload and other factors.  Each job is assigned to a particular pool, either a pool you created manually or an ‘auto pool’ created by the Batch service, and the job’s tasks then run on the compute nodes in that pool.  
  
 You can do the following with pools:  
  
-   [Add a pool to an account](../batchservice/add-a-pool-to-an-account.md)  
  
-   [Change the size of a pool](../batchservice/change-the-size-of-a-pool.md)  
  
-   [Delete a pool from an account](../batchservice/delete-a-pool-from-an-account.md)  
  
-   [Disable automatic scaling on a pool](../batchservice/disable-automatic-scaling-on-a-pool.md)  
  
-   [Enable automatic scaling on a pool](../batchservice/enable-automatic-scaling-on-a-pool.md)  
  
-   [Evaluate an automatic scaling formula](../batchservice/evaluate-an-automatic-scaling-formula.md)  
  
-   [Get information about a pool](../batchservice/get-information-about-a-pool.md)  
  
-   [List the compute nodes in a pool](../batchservice/list-the-compute-nodes-in-a-pool.md)  
  
-   [List the pools in the account](../batchservice/list-the-pools-in-the-account.md)  
  
-   [Remove compute nodes from a pool](../batchservice/remove-compute-nodes-from-a-pool.md)  
  
-   [Replace the properties of a pool](../batchservice/replace-the-properties-of-a-pool.md)  
  
-   [Stop changing the size of a pool](../batchservice/stop-changing-the-size-of-a-pool.md)  
  
-   [Update the properties of a pool](../batchservice/update-the-properties-of-a-pool.md)  
  
-   [Upgrade the operating system of compute nodes in a pool](../batchservice/upgrade-the-operating-system-of-compute-nodes-in-a-pool.md)
