# Batch API life cycle

Azure Batch is beginning to routinely deprecate API versions that are obsolete. All users of an API version are notified **three years** before final removal. Current users are notified via service notifications. Additional announcements are available on the Azure Updates blog (TODO: add link) and on this page.

Current users of the API version are notified that it will be deprecated. After TODO years, the API version is deprecated but still available. A deprecated API version differs from a non-deprecated version ... TODO. 

When an API version is deprecated, it's still available for **one year**. After one year, the API is removed and can no longer be used.

## Current API status

All Batch service and Management API versions newer than June 2017 are available and not slated for deprecation. All SDKs associated with these API versions are also available.
