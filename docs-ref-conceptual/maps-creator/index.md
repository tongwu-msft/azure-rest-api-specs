# Azure IoT Maps Creator Functional API

Creator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps API 
and SDK. The current creator services include Dataset, Conversion, FeatureState, Tileset, and WFS. These services 
allow a developer to use familiar tools to integrate location information into their Azure solutions. Azure 
Maps provides both web and mobile developers powerful geospatial capabilities supported by fresh mapping data.
