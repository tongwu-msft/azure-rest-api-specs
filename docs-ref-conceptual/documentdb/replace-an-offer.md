# Replace an Offer
  To replace an entire offer resource, perform a PUT operation on the specific user resource. There are two versions of offers currently supported – V1 for pre-defined throughput and V2 for user-defined throughput. You can modify the offer of collection for the following cases:  
  
-   OfferVersion V1: Between offerType values S1, S2, and S3.  
  
-   OfferVersion V2: If your collection is a single-partition collection i.e. created between 400 and 10,000 request units per second, then it can be modified to a value within 400-10,000 request units.  
  
-   OfferVersion V2:  If your collection is a partitioned collection i.e. created between 10,100 and 250,000 request units per second, then it can be modified to a value within 10,100-250,000 request units.  
  
-   Between V1 and V2: You can move between S1, S2, S3 and a V2 offer between 400 and 10,000 request units per second.  
  
## Request  
  
|Method|Request URI|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
|PUT|`https://{databaseaccount}.documents.azure.com/offers/{_rid-offer}`|Note that {databaseaccount} is the name of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created under your subscription. The {_rid-offer} value is the system generated resource ID of the offer.|  
  
### Headers  
 See [Common Azure Cosmos DB REST request headers](common-documentdb-rest-request-headers.md) for headers that are used by all Cosmos DB requests  
  
### Body  
  
|Property|Required|Description|  
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|  
|**offerVersion**|Required|This can be V1 for pre-defined throughput levels and V2 for user-defined throughput levels.|  
|**offerType**|Required|This is a user settable property, which must be set to S1, S2, or S3 for pre-defined performance levels, and Invalid for user-defined performance levels.|  
|**content**|Optional|Contains information about the offer – for V2 offers, this contains the throughput of the collection.|  
|**resource**|Required|When creating a new collection, this property is set to the self-link of the collection e.g. dbs/pLJdAA==/colls/pLJdAOlEdgA=/.|  
|**offerResourceId**|Required|During creation of a collection, this property is automatically associated to the resource id, i.e. **_rid** of the collection. In the example above, the **_rid** for the collection is pLJdAOlEdgA=.|  
|**id**|Required|This is a system generated property. The **id** for the offer resource is automatically generated when it is created. It has the same value as the **_rid** for the offer.|  
|**_rid**|Required|This is a system generated property. The resource ID (**_rid**) is a unique identifier that is also hierarchical per the resource stack on the resource model. It is used internally for placement and navigation of the offer.|
