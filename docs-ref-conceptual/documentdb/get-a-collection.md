# Get a Collection
  Performing a GET on a specific collection resource retrieves the properties for the collection.  
  
## Request  
  
|Method|Request URI|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
|GET|https://{databaseaccount}.documents.azure.com/dbs/{db-id}/colls/{coll-id}|Note that the {databaseaccount} is the name of the Azure Cosmos DB account created under your subscription. The {db-id} value is the user generated name/id of the database, not the system generated id (rid). The {coll-id} value is the name of the collection.|  
  
### Headers  
 See [Common Azure Cosmos DB REST request headers](common-documentdb-rest-request-headers.md) for headers that are used by all Cosmos DB requests.  
  
### Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 Get Collection returns the body of the collection as persisted in Cosmos DB along with response headers that report the quota and usage of the collection..  
  
### Headers  
 See [Common Azure Cosmos DB REST response headers](common-documentdb-rest-response-headers.md) for headers that are returned by all Cosmos DB responses.  
  
### Status codes  
 The following table lists common status codes returned by this operation. For a full list of status codes, see [HTTP Status Codes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783364.aspx).  
  
|HTTP status code|Description|  
|----------------------|-----------------|  
|200 Ok|The operation was successful.|  
|404 Not Found|The collection is no longer a resource, i.e. the collection was deleted.|  
  
### Body  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**id**|This is the unique name that identifies the new collection.|  
|**_rid**|This is a system generated property. The resource ID (**_rid**) is a unique identifier that is also hierarchical per the resource stack on the resource model. It is used internally for placement and navigation of the permission resource.|  
|**_ts**|This is a system generated property. It specifies the last updated timestamp of the resource. The value is a timestamp.|  
|**_self**|This is a system generated property. It is the unique addressable URI for the resource.|  
|**_etag**|This is a system generated property representing the resource **etag** required for optimistic concurrency control.|  
|**_doc**|This is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the documents resource.|  
|**_sprocs**|This is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the stored procedures (sprocs) resource.|  
|**_triggers**|This is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the triggers resource.|  
|**_udfs**|This is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the user-defined functions (udfs) resource.|  
|**_conflicts**|This is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the conflicts resource. During an operation on a resource within a collection, if a conflict occurs, users can inspect the conflicting resources by performing a GET on the conflicts URI path.|  
|**indexingPolicy**|This is the indexing policy settings for collection.|  
  
 **Properties under Indexing Policy**  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**automatic**|Indicates whether automatic indexing is on or off. The default value is True, thus all documents are indexed. Setting the value to False would allow manual configuration of indexing paths.|  
|**indexingMode**|By default, the indexing mode is Consistent. This means that indexing occurs synchronously during insertion, replacment or deletion of documents. To have indexing occur asynchronously, set the indexing mode to lazy.|  
|**includedPaths**|The array containing document paths to be indexed. By default, two paths are included: the / path which specifies that all document paths be indexed, and the _ts path, which indexes for a timestamp range comparison.<br /><br /> Within element in the array.|  
  
 **Properties under Included Path**  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**path**|Path for which the indexing behavior applies to. Index paths start with the root (/) and typically end with the ? wildcard operator, denoting that there are multiple possible values for the prefix. For example, to serve SELECT * FROM Families F WHERE F.familyName = "Andersen", you must include an index path for /familyName/? in the collection’s index policy.<br /><br /> Index paths can also use the \* wildcard operator to specify the behavior for paths recursively under the prefix. For example, /payload/\* can be used to exclude everything under the payload property from indexing.|  
|**dataType**|This is the datatype for which the indexing behavior is applied to. Can be **String**, **Number**, **Point**, **Polygon**, or **LineString**. Note that Booleans and nulls are automatically indexed|  
|**kind**|The type of index. **Hash** indexes are useful for equality comparisons while **Range** indexes are useful for equality, range comparisons and sorting. **Spatial** indexes are useful for spatial queries.|  
|**precision**|The precision of the index. Can be either set to -1 for maximum precision or between 1-8 for **Number**, and 1-100 for **String**. Not applicable for **Point**, **Polygon**, and **LineString** data types.|  
  
 **Properties under Partition Key**  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**paths**|An array of paths using which data within the collection can be partitioned. Paths must not contain a wildcard or a trailing slash. For example, the JSON property “AccountNumber” is specified as “/AccountNumber”. The array must contain only a single value.|  
|**kind**|The algorithm used for partitioning. Only **Hash** is supported.|
