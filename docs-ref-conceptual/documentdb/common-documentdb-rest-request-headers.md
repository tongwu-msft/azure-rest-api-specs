# Common Azure Cosmos DB REST request headers
The following request headers are common to all tasks that you might do with the DocumentDB API:  
  
|Header|Required|Type|Description|  
|------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|**Authorization**|Required|String|The authorization token for the request. For more information on generating a valid authorization token, see [Access Control on Cosmos DB Resources](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783368.aspx)|  
|**Content-Type**|Required (on PUT and POST)|String|For POST on query operations, it must be application/query+json.<br /><br /> For attachments, must be set to the Mime type of the attachment. For more information on Mime types, see [Create an Attachment](create-an-attachment.md)<br /><br /> For all other tasks, must be application/json.|  
|**If-Match**|Optional (applicable only on PUT and DELETE)|String|Used to make operation conditional for optimistic concurrency. The value should be the etag value of the resource.|  
|**If-None-Match**|Optional (applicable only on GET)|String|Makes operation conditional to only execute if the resource has changed. The value should be the etag of the resource.|  
|**If-Modified-Since**|Optional (applicable only on GET)|Date|Returns etag of resource modified after specified date in RFC 1123 format. Ignored when **If-None-Match** is specified | 
|**User-Agent**|Optional|String|A string that specifies the client user agent performing the request. The recommended format is {user agent name}/{version}. For example, the official DocumentDB API .NET SDK sets the User-Agent string to Microsoft.Document.Client/1.0.0.0. A custom user-agent could be something like ContosoMarketingApp/1.0.0.|  
|**x-ms-activity-id**|Optional|String|A client supplied identifier for the operation, which is echoed in the server response. The recommended value is a unique identifier.|  
|**x-ms-consistency-level**|Optional|String|The consistency level override for read options against documents and attachments. The valid values are: Strong, Bounded, Session, or Eventual (in order of strongest to weakest). The override must be the same or weaker than the account’s configured consistency level.|  
|**x-ms-continuation**|Optional|String|A string token returned for queries and read-feed operations if there are more results to be read. Clients can retrieve the next page of results by resubmitting the request with the x-ms-continuation request header set to this value.|  
|**x-ms-date**|Required|Date|The date of the request per RFC 1123 date format expressed in Coordinated Universal Time, for example, Fri, 08 Apr 2015 03:52:31 GMT.|  
|**x-ms-max-item-count**|Optional|Number|An integer indicating the maximum number of items to be returned per page. An x-ms-max-item-count of -1 can be specified to let the service determine the optimal item count. This is the recommended configuration value for x-ms-max-item-count|  
|**x-ms-documentdb-partitionkey**|Optional|Array|The partition key value for the requested document or attachment operation. Required for operations against documents and attachments when the collection definition includes a partition key definition. Supported in API versions 2015-12-16 and newer. Currently, Azure Cosmos DB supports a single partition key, so this is an array containing just one value.|  
|**x-ms-session-token**|Required (for session consistency only)|String|A string token used with session level consistency. For more information, see <br />                [Using consistency levels in Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/consistency-levels)|  
|**x-ms-version**|Required|String|The version of the Cosmos DB REST service. <br />                For a list of supported API versions, see [Azure Cosmos DB REST API Reference](index.md)|
