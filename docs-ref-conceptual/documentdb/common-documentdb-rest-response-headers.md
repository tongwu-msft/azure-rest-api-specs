# Common Azure Cosmos DB REST response headers
The following response headers are common to all responses from the DocumentDB API:  
  
|Header|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|**Content-Type**|The **Content-Type** is **application/json**. The DocumentDB API always returns the response body in standard JSON format.|  
|**Date**|The date time of the response operation. This date time format conforms to the RFC 1123 date time format expressed in Coordinated Universal Time.|  
|**etag**|The **etag** header shows the resource **etag** for the resource retrieved. The **etag** has the same value as the **_etag** property in the response body.|  
|**x-ms-activity-id**|Represents a unique identifier for the operation. This echoes the value of the x-ms-activity-id request header, and commonly used for troubleshooting purposes.|  
|**x-ms-alt-content-path**|The alternate path to the resource. Resources can be addressed in REST via system generated IDs or user supplied IDs. x-ms-alt-content-path represents the path constructed using user supplied IDs.|  
|**x-ms-continuation**|This header represents the intermediate state of query (or read-feed) execution, and is returned when there are additional results aside from what was returned in the response. Clients can resubmitted the request with a request header containing<br />                the value of x-ms-continuation.|  
|**x-ms-item-count**|The number of items returned for a query or read-feed request.|  
|**x-ms-request-charge**|This is the number of normalized requests a.k.a. request units (RU) for the operation. For more information, see [Request units in Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/request-units/).|  
|**x-ms-resource-quota**|Shows the allotted quota for a resource in an account.|  
|**x-ms-resource-usage**|Shows the current usage cout of a resource in an account. When deleting a resource, this shows the number of resources after the deletion. |  
|**x-ms-retry-after-ms**|The number of milliseconds to wait to retry the operation after an initial operation received HTTP status code 429 and was throttled.|  
|**x-ms-schemaversion**|Shows the resource schema version number.|  
|**x-ms-serviceversion**|Shows the service version number.|  
|**x-ms-session-token**|The session token of the request. For session consistency, clients must echo this request via the x-ms-session-token request header for subsequent operations made to the corresponding collection.|
