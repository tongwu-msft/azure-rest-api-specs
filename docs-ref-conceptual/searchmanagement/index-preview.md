# Preview Management REST APIs

Preview versions are released to test new functionality, gather feedback, and discover and fix issues. API version  `2020-08-01-Preview` includes all of the functionality of the generally available version (`2020-08-01`), but with preview support for creating [`sharedPrivateLinkResources`](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchmanagement/sharedprivatelinkresources) for Azure Functions and Azure Database for MySQL.

The last known preview version, `api-version=2019-10-01-Preview`, remains available. Any script or code that calls that version will work, but you could also modify code to use the stable version, or the new preview version, and get the same results.

> [!Important]
> Preview APIs are provided without a service level agreement, and are not recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
