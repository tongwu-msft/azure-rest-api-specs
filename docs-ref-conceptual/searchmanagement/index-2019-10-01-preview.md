# 2019-10-01-Preview Management REST APIs

> [!Important]
> Only those operations that differ from the generally available version are documented. Preview APIs are provided without a service level agreement, and are not recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). 

At this time the preview and stable versions of the search management REST API are equivalent in their functionality.

However, for isolating the service's API endpoint from internet by either setting up your IP address based firewall rules or by provisioning search service in private mode which can be accessed only from private endpoints, you must request access to this feature.

For more information about mechanisms for securing access to a private endpoint, see [Create a Private Endpoint for a secure connection to Azure Cognitive Search (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/service-create-private-endpoint).

This set of features is available in all data regions.
