# 2019-10-01-Preview

This preview version of the search management REST API includes functionality for provisioning a private search service, where access is restricted  to specific IP addresses. 

Using the search management REST API is only one approach for setting up private endpoints. For more information about mechanisms for securing access to an endpoint, see [Create a Private Endpoint for a secure connection to Azure Cognitive Search (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/service-create-private-endpoint).
