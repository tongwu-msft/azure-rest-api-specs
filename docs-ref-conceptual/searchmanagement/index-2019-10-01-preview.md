# 2019-10-01-Preview

This preview version of the search management REST API includes functionality for provisioning a private search service by restricting access to specific IP addresses. Using the search management REST API is only one approach. For more information about mechanisms for securing access to a search endpoint, see [Create a Private Endpoint for a secure connection to Azure Cognitive Search (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/service-create-private-endpoint).
