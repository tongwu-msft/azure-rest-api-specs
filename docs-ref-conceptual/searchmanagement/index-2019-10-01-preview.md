# 2019-10-01-Preview Management REST APIs

> [!Important]
> Only those operations that differ from the generally available version are documented. Preview APIs are provided without a service level agreement, and are not recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). 

At this time the preview and stable versions of the search management REST API are equivalent in their functionality.
