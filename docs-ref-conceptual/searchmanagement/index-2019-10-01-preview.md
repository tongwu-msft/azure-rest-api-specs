# Preview Management REST APIs

Preview versions are released to test new functionality, gather feedback, and discover and fix issues. At this time, there is no new preview version of the Management REST APIs for Azure Cognitive Search.

The last known preview version, `api-version=2019-10-01-Preview`, was the precursor to the current stable version of `api-version=2020-03-13`. The preview version remains available. Any script or code that calls that version will work, but you could also modify code to use the stable version and get the same results.

> [!Important]
> Preview APIs are provided without a service level agreement, and are not recommended for production workloads. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
