# Search Management

Azure Cognitive Search provides a REST API used with [Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/) to provision and administer a search service in an Azure subscription.

## Other SDKs

The REST APIs are foundational to Azure Cognitive Search. Any changes to the programming model are reflected in the REST APIs first.

Alternatives include the following SDKs, which are independently updated on separate release schedules:

+ [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/search/management)
+ [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/search/management?view=azure-python)
+ [Node.js (readme)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/search/resource-manager/readme.nodejs.md)
+ [TypeScript (readme)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/search/resource-manager/readme.typescript.md)
