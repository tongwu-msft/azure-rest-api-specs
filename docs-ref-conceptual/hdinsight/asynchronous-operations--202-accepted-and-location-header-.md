# Asynchronous Operations (202 Accepted and Location header)
Operations that complete asynchronously return HTTP 202 (Accepted) with a Location header and an optional Retry-After header. The time mentioned in the Retry-After header is in seconds with a minimum of 10 seconds and maximum of 10 minutes.  
  
 URI for the location header will be as follows:  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|GET|URL from the Location header|  
  
 If the operation is not complete, the response will be a HTTP 202 (Accepted) with the same location header.  
  
 If the operation completed successfully, the response will be the 200 (for anything that is not a DELETE) or 204 (for DELETE)  
  
 If the operation failed, the response will be formatted as per the [Error Response Content](#ErrorResponseContent).  
  
##  <a name="ErrorResponseContent"></a> Error Response Content  
 **Response Body**  
  
```  
{  
    "error": {  
        "code": "BadArgument",  
        "message": "User name has invalid characters"  
    }  
}  
  
```
