# Delete Alias (Preview REST API)

**API Version: 2021-04-30-Preview**

> [!Important]
> The entire API is a preview feature.

The **Delete Alias** operation removes an alias from your Azure Cognitive Search service.  

```http
DELETE https://[service name].search.windows.net/aliases/[alias name]?api-version=[api-version]      
  Content-Type: application/json  
  api-key: [admin key]  
```  

If you attempt to delete an index that is currently mapped to an alias, the operation will fail with 400 (Bad Request) and an error message stating that the alias(es) that's mapped to that index must be deleted or mapped to a different index before the index can be deleted.
