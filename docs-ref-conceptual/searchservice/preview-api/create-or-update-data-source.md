# Create or Update Data Source (Preview REST API)

**API Version: 2021-04-30-Preview, 2020-06-30-Preview**

> [!Important]
> 2021-04-30-Preview adds managed identity support for indexer connections to other Azure resources:
> + [**"credentials"**](#credentials) accepts an Azure resource ID as a value, provided that the search service runs under a managed identity and Azure role assignments grant read access to data.
> + **"identity"** accepts a user-assigned managed identity. This property is first-level for data connections. It's also under [**"encryptionKey"**](#encryptionkey) for retrieving a customer-managed key in Azure Key Vault.
> + **Azure Files** support is in preview. Use a preview API to index from this data source.
> 
> 2020-06-30-Preview adds:
> + [**"dataDeletionDetectionPolicy"**](#datadeletiondetectionpolicy) accepts "NativeBlobSoftDeleteDeletionDetectionPolicy" for blob indexers.
> + **Azure Database for MySQL** support is in preview. Use a preview API to index from this data source.
> + **Cosmos DB MongoDB API and Gremlin API** support is in preview. Use a preview API to index from this data source.

In Azure Cognitive Search, a data source is used with [indexers](../create-indexer.md), providing the connection information for on demand or scheduled data refresh of a target index, pulling data from [supported data sources](/azure/search/search-indexer-overview#supported-data-sources). 

You can use either POST or PUT on a create request. For either one, the request body provides the object definition.

```http  
POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/datasources?api-version=[api-version]  
    Content-Type: application/json  
    api-key: [admin key]  
```  

For update requests, use PUT and specify the indexer name on the URI. 

```http  
PUT https://[service name].search.windows.net/datasources/[data source name]?api-version=[api-version]
    Content-Type: application/json  
    api-key: [admin key]    
```

 HTTPS is required for all service requests. If the object doesn't exist, it's created. If it already exists, it's overwritten using the new definition.

> [!NOTE]  
> Once a data source exists, you cannot change the type property on an update request. Instead, you should create a new data source using the type you want.

## URI Parameters

| Parameter  | Description  |
|-------------|--------------|
| service name | Required. Set this to the unique, user-defined name of your search service. |
| data source name  | Required on the URI if using PUT. The name must be lower case, start with a letter or number, have no slashes or dots, and be fewer than 128 characters. After starting the name with a letter or number, the rest of the name can include any letter, number and dashes, as long as the dashes are not consecutive.  |
| api-version | Required. The current version is `api-version=2021-04-30-Preview`. See [API versions](../search-service-api-versions.md) for more versions.|

## Request Headers

The following table describes the required and optional request headers.  

|Fields              |Description      |  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|Content-Type|Required. Set this to `application/json`|  
|api-key|Required. The `api-key` is used to authenticate the request to your Search service. It's a string value, unique to your service. Create requests must include an `api-key` header set to your admin key (as opposed to a query key). You can [find the API key](/azure/search/search-security-api-keys#find-existing-keys) in your search service dashboard in the Azure portal.|  

## Request Body

The body of the request contains a data source definition, which includes type of the data source, credentials to read the data, as well as an optional data change detection and data deletion detection policies that are used to efficiently identify changed or deleted data in the data source when used with a periodically scheduled indexer  

The following JSON is a high-level representation of the main parts of the definition.

## Response

For a successful request: 201 Created if a new data source was created, and 204 No Content if an existing data source was updated. 

## Examples

**Example: Azure roles and a system-assigned managed identity**

```json
{
    "name": "azure-blob-ds",
    "description": "a description of the blob data",
    "type": "azureblob",
    "subtype": null,
    "credentials": {
      "connectionString": "ResourceId=/subscriptions/[subscription ID]/resourceGroups/[resource group name]/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/[storage account name]/;"
    },
    "container": {
      "name": "mycontainer"
    },
    "dataChangeDetectionPolicy": null,
    "dataDeletionDetectionPolicy": null,
  }
```

**Example: Azure roles and a user-assigned managed identity (preview)**

```json
{
    "name": "azure-blob-ds",
    "description": "a description of the blob data",
    "type": "azureblob",
    "subtype": null,
    "credentials": {
      "connectionString": "ResourceId=/subscriptions/[subscription ID]/resourceGroups/[resource group name]/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/[storage account name]/;"
    },
    "container": {
      "name": "mycontainer"
    },
    "dataChangeDetectionPolicy": null,
    "dataDeletionDetectionPolicy": null,
    "identity": {
      "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.DataUserAssignedIdentity",
      "userAssignedIdentity": "/subscriptions/[subscription ID]/resourceGroups/[resource group name]/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/[user identity name]"
    }
  }
```

**Example: Azure SQL with change detection (High Watermark Change Detection Policy)**

```json
{   
    "name" : "asqldatasource",  
    "description" : "a description",  
    "type" : "azuresql",  
    "credentials" : { "connectionString" : "Server=tcp:....database.windows.net,1433;Database=...;User ID=...;Password=...;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=30;" },  
    "container" : { "name" : "sometable" },  
    "dataChangeDetectionPolicy" : { "@odata.type" : "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.HighWaterMarkChangeDetectionPolicy", "highWaterMarkColumnName" : "RowVersion" }
}  
```

**Example: Azure SQL with change detection (SQL Integrated Change Tracking Policy)**

```json
{   
    "name" : "asqldatasource",  
    "description" : "a description",  
    "type" : "azuresql",  
    "credentials" : { "connectionString" : "Server=tcp:....database.windows.net,1433;Database=...;User ID=...;Password=...;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=30;" },  
    "container" : { "name" : "sometable" },  
    "dataChangeDetectionPolicy" : { "@odata.type" : "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.SqlIntegratedChangeTrackingPolicy" }
}  
```

**Example: Azure SQL with change detection with deletion detection**

Recall that the properties for deletion detection are "softDeleteColumnName" and "softDeleteMarkerValue".

```json
{   
    "name" : "asqldatasource",  
    "description" : "a description",  
    "type" : "azuresql",  
    "credentials" : { "connectionString" : "Server=tcp:....database.windows.net,1433;Database=...;User ID=...;Password=...;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=30;" },  
    "container" : { "name" : "sometable" },   
    "dataDeletionDetectionPolicy" : { "@odata.type" : "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.SoftDeleteColumnDeletionDetectionPolicy", "softDeleteColumnName" : "IsDeleted", "softDeleteMarkerValue" : "true" }  
}  
```

**Example: Data source with required properties only**

Optional properties related to change and deletion detection can be omitted if you only intend to use the data source for one-time copy of the data:  

```json
{   
    "name" : "asqldatasource",  
    "description" : "anything you want, or nothing at all",  
    "type" : "azuresql",  
    "credentials" : { "connectionString" : "Server=tcp:....database.windows.net,1433;Database=...;User ID=...;Password=...;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=30;" },  
    "container" : { "name" : "sometable" }  
}   
```  

**Example: Using the unchanged or redacted credential option**

If you intend to update the data source, the credentials are not required. The values `<unchanged>` or `<redacted>` can be used in place of the connection string.

```json
{
    "name" : "adatasource",
    "description": "a description",
    "type": "azuresql",
    "credentials": { "connectionString": "<unchanged>" },
    "container" : { "name": "sometable" }
}
```

**Example: Encryption keys**

Encryption keys are customer-managed keys used for additional encryption. For more information, see [Encryption using customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault](/azure/search/search-security-manage-encryption-keys).

```json
{
    "name" : "adatasource",
    "description": "a description",
    "type": "azuresql",
    "credentials": { "connectionString": "<unchanged>" },
    "container" : { "name": "sometable" },
    "encryptionKey": (optional) { 
      "keyVaultKeyName": "Name of the Azure Key Vault key used for encryption",
      "keyVaultKeyVersion": "Version of the Azure Key Vault key",
      "keyVaultUri": "URI of Azure Key Vault, also referred to as DNS name, that provides the key. An example URI might be https://my-keyvault-name.vault.azure.net",
      "accessCredentials": (optional, only if not using managed identity) {
        "applicationId": "Azure Active Directory Application ID that was granted access permissions to your specified Azure Key Vault",
        "applicationSecret": "Authentication key of the specified Azure AD application)"}
      }
}
```

**Example: Encryption key vault connections by search services having a user-assigned managed identity**

This example omits accessCredentials. For a resource that has a [user-assigned managed identity](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal) assigned to it, you can specify the identity in encryptionKey and retrieve the key using that identity and Azure role assignments.

```json
{
    "name" : "adatasource",
    "description": "a description",
    "type": "azuresql",
    "credentials": { "connectionString": "<unchanged>" },
    "container" : { "name": "sometable" },
    "encryptionKey": (optional) { 
      "keyVaultKeyName": "Name of the Azure Key Vault key used for encryption",
      "keyVaultKeyVersion": "Version of the Azure Key Vault key",
      "keyVaultUri": "URI of Azure Key Vault, also referred to as DNS name, that provides the key. An example URI might be https://my-keyvault-name.vault.azure.net",
      "identity": {
        "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.DataUserAssignedIdentity",
        "userAssignedIdentity": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/contoso-rg/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/contoso-identity"
        }
    }
}
```

## Definitions

|Link|Description|
|--|--|
| [container](#container) | Specifies the container, collection, table, or view containing the data to be indexed. |
| [credentials](#credentials) |  Contains a `connectionString` property that specifies how an indexer connects to an Azure resource. |
| [dataChangeDetectionPolicy](#datachangedetectionpolicy) | Specifies the mechanism provided by the data platform for identifying changed data. |
| [dataDeletionDetectionPolicy](#datadeletiondetectionpolicy) | Specifies the mechanism for detecting deleted data. |
| [encryptionKey](#encryptionkey) | Configures a connection to Azure Key Vault for customer-managed encryption. |

<a name="container"> </a>

### container

Specifies the container, collection, table, or view containing the data to be indexed.

|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------| 
| name | Required. For Azure Cosmos DB, specifies the SQL API collection. For Azure Blob Storage, specifies the storage container. For Azure SQL, specifies the table or view. You can use schema-qualified names, such as `[dbo].[mytable]`. For Azure Table Storage, specifies the name of the table. |
| query | Optional. For Azure Cosmos DB, allows you to specify a query that flattens an arbitrary JSON document layout into a flat schema that Azure Cognitive Search can index. For Azure Blob Storage, allows you to specify a virtual folder within the blob container. For example, for blob path `mycontainer/documents/blob.pdf`, `documents` can be used as the virtual folder. For Azure Table Storage, allows you to specify a query that filters the set of rows to be imported. For Azure SQL, query is not supported (use views instead).|

<a name="credentials"> </a>

### credentials

Contains a "connectionString" property that specifies how an indexer connects to an Azure resource. 

|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|connectionString| Required. Specifies a connection to an indexer data source. If you are updating the data source definition, the connection string is not required. The values `<unchanged>` or `<redacted>` can be used in place of the actual connection string. </p>For connections that are authenticated using keys or login credentials, those values are visible in the connection string. The format of the connection string depends on the data source type: </br></br>For Azure SQL Database, this is the usual SQL Server connection string. If you're using Azure portal to retrieve the connection string, choose the `ADO.NET connection string` option. </br></br>For Azure Cosmos DB, the connection string must be in the following format: `"AccountEndpoint=https://[your account name].documents.azure.com;AccountKey=[your account key];Database=[your database id]"`. All of the values are required. You can find them in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). </p>If you are using a [managed identity to authenticate](/azure/search/search-howto-managed-identities-data-sources), you can omit credentials on the connection. |

For connections that are authenticated using a managed identity, the connection string includes the resource ID (see these links for connection string format: [Azure Storage](/azure/search/search-howto-managed-identities-storage), [Cosmos DB](/azure/search/search-howto-managed-identities-cosmos-db),[SQL Database](/azure/search/search-howto-managed-identities-sql)). 

Role assignments scoped to the external data source determine whether the indexer can connect, and the search service must be configured to run as a trusted service in Azure Active Directory. 

If the "identity" property is also specified, the connection is made using the user-assigned managed identity provided by the "identity" property. Otherwise, if "identity" is unspecified or null, the connection is through the system-managed identity.

<a name="dataChangeDetectionPolicy"> </a>

### dataChangeDetectionPolicy

Specifies the mechanism provided by the data platform for identifying changed data. Supported policies vary based on the data source type. 

|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
| dataChangeDetectionPolicy | Optional. Valid policies include `HighWatermarkChangeDetectionPolicy` or `SqlIntegratedChangeDetectionPolicy`. </p>`HighWatermarkChangeDetectionPolicy` depends on an existing column or property that is updated in tandem with other updates (all inserts result in an update to the watermark column), and the change in value is higher. </p>`SqlIntegratedChangeDetectionPolicy` is used to reference the native change detection features in SQL Server.  This policy can only be used with tables; it cannot be used with views. You need to enable change tracking for the table you're using before you can use this policy. See [Enable and disable change tracking](/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/enable-and-disable-change-tracking-sql-server) for instructions. | 
| highWaterMarkColumnName | Required for `HighWatermarkChangeDetectionPolicy`. For Cosmos DB, the column must be `_ts` property. For Azure SQL, an indexed `rowversion` column is recommended. For Azure Storage, change detection is built-in using lastModified values, eliminating any need to set the dataChangeDetectionPolicy. |

<a name="dataDeletionDetectionPolicy"> </a>

### dataDeletionDetectionPolicy

Specifies the mechanism provided by the data platform for identifying deleted data. Supported policies vary based on the data source type. 

|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------| 
|dataDeletionDetectionPolicy | Optional. Valid values are `SoftDeleteColumnDeletionDetectionPolicy` or `NativeBlobSoftDeleteDeletionDetectionPolicy` (see [Native blob soft delete (preview)](/azure/search/search-howto-index-changed-deleted-blobs#native-blob-soft-delete-preview)). </p>Currently, the only generally available policy is`SoftDeleteColumnDeletionDetectionPolicy`, which identifies deleted items based on the value of a 'soft delete' column or property in the data source. </br></br>  |
| softDeleteColumnName" | Required. Name of a column in your data source providing a value that specifies a row's deletion status. For example, you could create a column named "IsDeleted". Only columns with string, integer, or boolean values are supported. |
| softDeleteMarkerValue | Required. The value of the soft delete column. The value used as `softDeleteMarkerValue` must be a string, even if the corresponding column holds integers or booleans. For example, if the value that appears in your data source is 1, use "1" as the `softDeleteMarkerValue`. If the indexer reads this value from the soft delete column, it deletes the corresponding search document from the search index. |

<a name="encryptionKey"> </a>

### encryptionKey

Configures a connection to Azure Key Vault for supplemental [customer-managed encryption keys (CMK)](/azure/search/search-security-manage-encryption-keys). Encryption with customer-managed keys is not available for free services. For billable services, it's only available for search services created on or after 2019-01-01.

A connection to the key vault must be authenticated. You can use either "accessCredentials" or a managed identity for this purpose. 

Managed identities can be system or user-assigned (preview). If the search service has both a system-assigned managed identity and a role assignment that grants read access to the key vault, you can omit both "identity" and "accessCredentials", and the request will authenticate using the managed identity. If the search service has user-assigned identity and role assignment, set the "identity" property to the resource ID of that identity.

|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
| keyVaultKeyName | Required. Name of the Azure Key Vault key used for encryption. |
| keyVaultKeyVersion | Required. Version of the Azure Key Vault key. |
| keyVaultUri  | Required. URI of Azure Key Vault, also referred to as DNS name, that provides the key. An example URI might be `https://my-keyvault-name.vault.azure.net`. |
| accessCredentials | Omit if you're using a managed identity. Otherwise, the properties of `accessCredentials` include `applicationId` (an Azure Active Directory Application ID that has access permissions to your specified Azure Key Vault), and `applicationSecret` (the authentication key of the specified Azure AD application). |
| identity | Optional unless you are using a user-assigned managed identity for the search service connection to Azure Key Vault. The format is `"/subscriptions/[subscription ID]/resourceGroups/[resource group name]/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/[managed identity name]"`. |
