# Get Synonym Map (Azure Search Service REST API)
> [!NOTE]  
> Synonyms is a preview feature and is not intended to be used in production code. Preview features are subject to change and are exempt from the service level agreement (SLA).

## Request
  The **Get Synonym Map** operation gets the synonym map definition from Azure Search.  

```  
GET https://[service name].search.windows.net/synonymmaps/[synonymmap name]?api-version=[api-version]  
api-key: [admin key]  
```  

 The **api-version** is required. The current preview version is `2016-09-01-Preview`. See [API versions in Azure Search](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=834796) for details.  

### Request Headers
  The following list describes the required and optional request headers.  

 |Request Header|Description|  
 |--------------------|-----------------|  
 |*Content-Type:*|Required. Set this to `application/json`|  
 |*api-key:*|Required. The `api-key` is used to authenticate the request to your Search service. It is a string value, unique to your service. The **Get Synonym Map** request must include an `api-key` header set to your admin key (as opposed to a query key).|  

  You will also need the service name to construct the request URL. You can get both the service name and `api-key` from your service dashboard in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). See [Create an Azure Search service in the portal](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/search-create-service-portal/) for page navigation help.  

## Response  
 Status Code: 200 OK is returned for a successful response.  

 The response is similar to examples in [Create Synonym Map &#40;Azure Search Service REST API&#41;](create-synonym-map.md).  

```  
{   
    "name" : "synonymmap1",  
    "format" : "solr",  
    "synonyms" : "United States, United States of America, USA\n
    Washington, Wash. => WA"
}  

```
