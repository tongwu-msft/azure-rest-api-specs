# Get Indexer (Azure Cognitive Search REST API)

The **Get Indexer** operation gets the indexer definition from Azure Cognitive Search.  

```http  
GET https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers/[indexer name]?api-version=[api-version]  
  Content-Type: application/json  
  api-key: [admin key]
```  

## URI Parameters

| Parameter  | Description  |
|-------------|--------------|
| service name | Required. Set this to the unique, user-defined name of your search service. |
| indexer name  | Required. The request URI specifies the name of the indexer to return. |
| api-version | Required. The current stable version is `api-version=2020-06-30`. See [API versions](search-service-api-versions.md) for more versions.|

## Request Headers

The following table describes the required and optional request headers.  

|Fields              |Description      |  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|Content-Type|Required. Set this to `application/json`|  
|api-key|Required. The api-key is used to authenticate the request to your Search service. It is a string value, unique to your service. Get requests for an object definition must include an api-key field set to your admin key (as opposed to a query key). You can [find the API key](/azure/search/search-security-api-keys#find-existing-keys) in your search service dashboard in the Azure portal.|  

## Request Body

 None.

## Response

 Status Code: 200 OK is returned for a successful response. The response is similar to examples in [Create Indexer &#40;Azure Cognitive Search REST API&#41;](create-indexer.md):

```json
{  
    "name" : "myindexer",  
    "description" : "a cool indexer",  
    "dataSourceName" : "ordersds",  
    "targetIndexName" : "orders",  
    "schedule" : { "interval" : "PT1H", "startTime" : "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z" },  
    "parameters" : { "maxFailedItems" : 10, "maxFailedItemsPerBatch" : 5, "base64EncodeKeys": false },
    "encryptionKey": null
}  
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the indexer has an [encryption key](/azure/search/search-security-manage-encryption-keys), the search service must have access to the encryption key to retrieve the indexer definition. Without access to the encryption key, a 400 Bad Request is returned. Restoring access to the key allows the search service to retrieve the indexer definition again.
