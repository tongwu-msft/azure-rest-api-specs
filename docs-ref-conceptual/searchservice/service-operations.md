# Service operations (Azure Cognitive Search REST API)

While most of the Azure Cognitive Search REST APIs apply to a particular resource in your Search service such as an index, data source, and so on, some APIs are global to the Search service itself. Currently, the only service-level operation returns information about resource consumption and service limits.
