# List Data Sources (Azure Search Service REST API)
  The **List Data Sources** operation returns a list of the data sources in your Azure Search service.  

```  
GET https://[service name].search.windows.net/datasources?api-version=[api-version]  
    api-key: [admin key]  
```  

 The `api-version` is required. The current version is `2016-09-01`. See [API versions in Azure Search](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=834796) for details.  

 The `api-key` must be an admin key (as opposed to a query key). Refer to the authentication section in [Azure Search Service REST](index.md) to learn more about keys. [Create an Azure Search service in the portal](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/search-create-service-portal/) explains how to get the service URL and key properties used in the request.  

## Response  
 For a successful request: 200 OK. Here is an example response body:  

```  
    {  
      "value" : [  
        {  
          "name": "datasource1",  
          "type": "azuresql",  
          ... other data source properties  
        }]  
    }  
```  

 Note that you can filter the response down to just the properties you're interested in. For example, if you want only a list of data source names, use the OData **select** query option:  

```  
GET /datasources?api-version=2016-09-01&$select=name  
```  

 In this case, the response from the above example would appear as follows:  

```  
    {  
      "value" : [ { "name": "datasource1" }, ... ]  
    }  
```
