# Delete Skillset (Azure Cognitive Search REST API)

The **Delete Skillset** operation removes a skillset and its contents from your Azure Cognitive Search service.  

```http  
DELETE https://[service name].search.windows.net/skillsets/[skillset name]?api-version=[api-version]
  Content-Type: application/json  
  api-key: [admin key]  
```  

 When a skillset is deleted, any indexers currently in execution that reference the skillset run to completion, but no further references will be made. Attempts to use a non-existent skillset will result in HTTP status code 404 Not Found.  

  ## URI Parameters

|-------------|--------------|
| service name | Required. Set this to the unique, user-defined name of your search service. |
| skillset name  | Required. The request URI specifies the name of the skillset to delete.   |
| api-version | Required. The current stable version is `api-version=2020-06-30`. See [API versions](search-service-api-versions.md) for more versions.|
