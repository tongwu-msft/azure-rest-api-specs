# Delete Data Source (Azure Search Service REST API)
  The **Delete Data Source** operation removes a data source from your Azure Search service.  

```  
DELETE https://[service name].search.windows.net/datasources/[datasource name]?api-version=[api-version]  
api-key: [admin key]  
```  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If any indexers reference the data source that you're deleting, the delete operation will still proceed. However, those indexers will transition into an error state upon their next run.  

 The **api-version** is required. The current version is `2017-11-11`. See [API versions in Azure Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-api-versions) for details.  

 The **api-key** must be an admin key (as opposed to a query key). Refer to the authentication section in [Azure Search Service REST](index.md) to learn more about keys. [Create an Azure Search service in the portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/search-create-service-portal/) explains how to get the service URL and key properties used in the request.
