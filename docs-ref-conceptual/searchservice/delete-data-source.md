# Delete Data Source (Azure Cognitive Search REST API)

The **Delete Data Source** operation removes a data source from your Azure Cognitive Search service.  

```http
DELETE https://[service name].search.windows.net/datasources/[datasource name]?api-version=[api-version]  
  Content-Type: application/json  
  api-key: [admin key]   
```  

If any indexers reference the data source that you're deleting, the delete operation will still proceed. However, those indexers will transition into an error state upon their next run.  

 ## URI Parameters

| Parameter	  | Description  | 
|-------------|--------------|
| service name | Required. Set this to the unique, user-defined name of your search service. |
| datasource name  | Required. The request URI specifies the name of the data source to delete.   |
| api-version | Required. The current stable version is `api-version=2020-06-30`. See [API versions](search-service-api-versions.md) for more versions.|

## Request Headers 

The following table describes the required and optional request headers.  

|Fields              |Description      |  
|--------------------|-----------------|

|api-key|Required. The api-key is used to authenticate the request to your Search service. It is a string value, unique to your service.
