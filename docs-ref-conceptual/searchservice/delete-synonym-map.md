# Delete Synonym Map (Azure Cognitive Search REST API)

The **Delete Synonym Map** operation removes a synonym map from your Azure Cognitive Search service.  

```http 
DELETE https://[service name].search.windows.net/synonymmaps/[synonymmap name]?api-version=[api-version]  
  Content-Type: application/json  
  api-key: [admin key]  
```  

If you delete a synonym map that is referenced on a field in an index, the delete operation will proceed but searches against the fields will fail with 400 (Bad Request) and an error message stating that the synonym map has been deleted.
