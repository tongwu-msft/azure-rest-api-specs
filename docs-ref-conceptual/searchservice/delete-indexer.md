# Delete Indexer (Azure Search Service REST API)
  The **Delete Indexer** operation removes an indexer from your Azure Search service.  

```  
DELETE https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers/[indexer name]?api-version=[api-version]  
    api-key: [admin key]  
```  

 When an indexer is deleted, the indexer executions in progress at that time will run to completion, but no further executions will be scheduled. Attempts to use a non-existent indexer will result in HTTP status code 404 Not Found.  

 The **api-version** is required. The current version is `2016-09-01`. See [API versions in Azure Search](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=834796) for details.  

 The **api-key** must be an admin key (as opposed to a query key). Refer to the authentication section in [Azure Search Service REST](index.md) to learn more about keys. [Create an Azure Search service in the portal](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/search-create-service-portal/) explains how to get the service URL and key properties used in the request.  

## Response  
 Status Code: 204 No Content is returned for a successful response.
