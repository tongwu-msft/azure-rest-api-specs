# Delete Indexer (Azure Cognitive Search REST API)
The **Delete Indexer** operation removes an indexer from your Azure Cognitive Search service.  

```http 
DELETE https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers/[indexer name]?api-version=[api-version]  
  Content-Type: application/json  
  api-key: [admin key]  
```  

When an indexer is deleted, the indexer executions in progress at that time will run to completion, but no further executions will be scheduled. Attempts to use a non-existent indexer will result in HTTP status code 404 Not Found.
