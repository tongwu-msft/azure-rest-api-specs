# Delete Indexer (Azure Cognitive Search REST API)
  The **Delete Indexer** operation removes an indexer from your Azure Cognitive Search service.  

```  
DELETE https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexers/[indexer name]?api-version=[api-version]  
    api-key: [admin key]  
```  

 When an indexer is deleted, the indexer executions in progress at that time will run to completion, but no further executions will be scheduled. Attempts to use a non-existent indexer will result in HTTP status code 404 Not Found.  

 The **api-version** is required. The current version is `2019-05-06`. See [API versions in Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-api-versions) for details.  

 The **api-key** must be an admin key (as opposed to a query key). Refer to the authentication section in [Azure Cognitive Search REST APIs](index.md) to learn more about keys. [Create an Azure Cognitive Search service in the portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/search-create-service-portal/) explains how to get the service URL and key properties used in the request.
