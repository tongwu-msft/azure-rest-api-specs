# Add, Update or Delete Documents (Azure Search Service REST API)
  You can upload, merge or delete documents from a specified index using HTTP POST. For large numbers of updates, batching of documents (up to 1000 documents per batch, or about 16 MB per batch) is recommended.  

```  
POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes/[index name]/docs/index?api-version=[api-version]   
Content-Type: application/json   
api-key: [admin key]  
```  

> [!NOTE]  
>  For supported data sources, indexers offer an alternative methodology for loading and refreshing rowsets to Azure Search on an ad hoc or scheduled basis. See [Indexer operations &#40;Azure Search Service REST API&#41;](indexer-operations.md) for details.  

## Request  
 HTTPS is required for all service requests. You can upload, merge, merge-or-upload, or delete documents from a specified index using HTTP POST.  

 `POST /indexes/[index name]/docs/index?api-version=[api-version]`  

 The request URI includes, `[index name]`, specifying which index to post documents. You can only post documents to one index at a time.  

 The `api-version` parameter is required. The current version is `api-version=2016-09-01`. See [API versions in Azure Search](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=834796) for a list of available versions.  

### Request Headers  
 The following table describes the required and optional request headers.  

|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|*Content-Type:*|Required. Set this to `application/json`|  
|*api-key:*|Required. The `api-key` is used to authenticate the request to your Search service. It is a string value, unique to your service. The **Add Documents** request must include an `api-key` header set to your admin key (as opposed to a query key).|  

 You will also need the service name to construct the request URL. You can get the service name and `api-key` from your service dashboard in the Azure Preview Portal. See [Create an Azure Search service in the portal](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/search-create-service-portal/) for page navigation help.  

### Request Body  
 The body of the request contains one or more documents to be indexed. Documents are identified by a unique key. Each document is associated with an action: upload, merge, mergeOrupload, or delete. Upload requests must include the document data as a set of key/value pairs.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  Document keys can only contain letters, numbers, dashes ("-"), underscores ("_"), and equal signs ("="). For more details, see [Naming rules &#40;Azure Search&#41;](naming-rules.md).  

```  
{  
  "value": [  
    {  
      "@search.action": "upload (default) | merge | mergeOrUpload | delete",  
      "key_field_name": "unique_key_of_document", (key/value pair for key field from index schema)  
      "field_name": field_value (key/value pairs matching index schema)  
        ...  
    },  
    ...  
  ]  
}  
```  

#### Document Actions  
 You can combine actions, such as an **upload** and a **delete**, in the same batch.  

-   **upload**: An upload action is similar to an "upsert" where the document will be inserted if it is new and updated/replaced if it exists. Note that all fields are replaced in the update case.  

-   **merge**: Merge updates an existing document with the specified fields. If the document doesn't exist, the merge will fail. Any field you specify in a merge will replace the existing field in the document. This includes fields of type `Collection(Edm.String)`. For example, if the document contains a field "tags" with value ["budget"] and you execute a merge with value ["economy", "pool"] for "tags", the final value of the "tags" field will be ["economy", "pool"]. It will not be ["budget", "economy", "pool"].  

-   **mergeOrUpload**: This action behaves like **merge** if a document with the given key already exists in the index. If the document does not exist, it behaves like **upload** with a new document.  

-   **delete**: Delete removes the specified document from the index. Note that any field you specify in a delete operation, other than the **key** field,  will be ignored. If you want to remove an individual field from a document, use merge instead and simply set the field explicitly to null.  

### Response  
Status code 200 (OK) is returned for a successful response, meaning that all items have been stored durably and will start to be indexed. Indexing runs in the background and makes new documents available (that is, queryable and searchable) a few seconds after the indexing operation completed. The specific delay depends on the load on the service.

Successful indexing is indicated by the `status` property being set to true for all items, as well as the `statusCode` property being set to either 201 (for newly uploaded documents) or 200 (for merged or deleted documents):

```  
{  
  "value": [  
    {  
      "key": "unique_key_of_document",  
      "status": true,  
      "errorMessage": null  
    }  
  ]  
}  
```  

 Status code: 207 is returned when at least one item was not successfully indexed (as indicated by the 'status' field set to false for items that have not been indexed):  

```  
{  
  "value": [  
    {  
      "key": "unique_key_of_document",  
      "status": false,  
      "errorMessage": "The search service is too busy to process this document. Please try again later."  
    }  
  ]  
}  
```  

 The errorMessage property will indicate the reason for the indexing error if possible.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  If your client code frequently encounters a 207 response, one possible reason is that the system is under load. You can confirm this by checking the errorMessage property. If this is the case, we recommend throttling indexing requests. Otherwise, if indexing traffic doesn't subside, the system could start rejecting all requests with 503 errors  

 Status code: 429 indicates that you have exceeded your quota on the number of documents per index. You must either create a new index or upgrade for higher capacity limits.  

## Example  

```  
{  
  "value": [  
    {  
      "@search.action": "upload",  
      "hotelId": "1",  
      "baseRate": 199.0,  
      "description": "Best hotel in town",  
      "description_fr": "Meilleur hôtel en ville",   
      "hotelName": "Fancy Stay",  
      "category": "Luxury",  
      "tags": ["pool", "view", "wifi", "concierge"],  
      "parkingIncluded": false,  
      "smokingAllowed": false,  
      "lastRenovationDate": "2010-06-27T00:00:00Z",  
      "rating": 5,  
      "location": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-122.131577, 47.678581] }  
    },  
    {  
      "@search.action": "upload",  
      "hotelId": "2",  
      "baseRate": 79.99,  
      "description": "Cheapest hotel in town",  
      "description_fr": "Hôtel le moins cher en ville",  
      "hotelName": "Roach Motel",  
      "category": "Budget",  
      "tags": ["motel", "budget"],  
      "parkingIncluded": true,  
      "smokingAllowed": true,  
      "lastRenovationDate": "1982-04-28T00:00:00Z",  
      "rating": 1,  
      "location": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-122.131577, 49.678581] }  
    },  
    {  
      "@search.action": "merge",  
      "hotelId": "3",  
      "baseRate": 279.99,  
      "description": "Surprisingly expensive",  
      "lastRenovationDate": null  
    },  
    {  
      "@search.action": "delete",  
      "hotelId": "4"  
    }  
  ]  
}  
```  

> [!NOTE]
> When you upload `DateTimeOffset` values with time zone information to your index, Azure Search normalizes these values to UTC. For example, `2017-01-13T14:03:00-08:00` will be stored as `2017-01-13T22:03:00Z`. If you need to store time zone information, you will need to add an extra column to your index.
