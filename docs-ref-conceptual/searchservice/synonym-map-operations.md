# Synonym Map Operations (Azure Search Service REST API)
> [!NOTE]  
> Synonyms is a preview feature and is not intended to be used in production code. Preview features are subject to change and are exempt from the service level agreement (SLA).

  In Azure Search, developers can define custom rules to expand or rewrite a search query with equivalent terms. For example, in your application, the words "whirlpool", "jacuzzi" and "hot tub" may be equivalent and you want to have a rule that automatically expands the search when only one is searched for. The resource that contains the rules is called a synonym map. Synonym maps are service level resources and maintained independently from search indexes. Once a synonym map is uploaded, you can point any searchable field to the synonym map (one per field).

## Availability

  The synonyms feature is currently only available in the latest preview API version `2016-09-01-Preview`. You can use the preview REST API or [preview .NET SDK](https://aka.ms/search-sdk-preview) to evaluate synonyms.

## Workflow  

  Setting up synonyms in your search application is a two-step process:

  1.	Add a synonym map to your search service. You can use the search service REST API to create and manage **synonym maps**. Please see the section below titled "Operations on synonym maps" for the supported operations and [Create Synonym Map](create-synonym-map.md) for the request body.

  2.	Configure a searchable field to use the synonym map in the index definition. A new field property **synonymMaps** specifies a synonym map to use for the field.

  For example, the index definition below configures the 'name' field to use the synonym map 'mysynonymmap'.
  ```
	POST https://[servicename].search.windows.net/indexes?api-version=2016-09-01-Preview
	api-key: [admin key]

	{
	   "name":"myindex",
	   "fields":[
	      {
	         "name":"id",
	         "type":"Edm.String",
	         "key":true
	      },
	      {
	         "name":"name",
	         "type":"Edm.String",
	         "searchable":true,
	         "analyzer":"en.lucene",
	         "synonymMaps":[
	            "mysynonymmap"
	         ]
	      }
	   ]
	}
  ```

  You can update the **synonymMaps** properties of existing fields at any time.

## Operations on synonym maps  
 The REST API for **synonym maps** includes the operations shown in the following table.  

 [Create Synonym Map](create-synonym-map.md)

```  

```  
PUT https://[service name].search.windows.net/synonymmaps/[synonymmap name]?api-version=[api-version]  
Content-Type: application/json  
api-key: [admin key]  
```  

 [Update Synonym Map](update-synonym-map.md)  

```  
PUT https://[service name].search.windows.net/synonymmaps/[synonymmap name]?api-version=[api-version]  
Content-Type: application/json  
api-key: [admin key]

 [List Synonym Maps](list-synonym-maps.md)  

```  
GET https://[service name].search.windows.net/synonymmaps?api-version=[api-version]  
api-key: [admin key]  
```  

 [Get Synonym Map](get-synonym-map.md)  

```  
GET https://[service name].search.windows.net/synonymmaps/[synonymmap name]?api-version=[api-version]
