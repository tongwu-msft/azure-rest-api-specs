# Get Index Statistics (Azure Cognitive Search REST API)
The **Get Index Statistics** operation returns from Azure Cognitive Search a document count for the current index, plus storage usage. You can also get this information from the portal.  

 > [!NOTE] 
 > Statistics on document count and storage size are collected every few minutes, not in real time. Therefore, the statistics returned by this API may not reflect changes caused by recent indexing operations. 

```http  
GET https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes/[index name]/stats?api-version=[api-version]  
  Content-Type: application/json  
  api-key: [admin key]   
```
