# Delete Index (Azure Cognitive Search REST API)

The **Delete Index** operation permanently removes an index and its contents from your Azure Cognitive Search service. This operation is final, with no recovery option. Make sure you have a master copy of your index definition code, data ingestion code, and a backup of the external data source in case a rebuild is required.
  
```http  
DELETE https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes/[index name]?api-version=[api-version]  
  Content-Type: application/json  
  api-key: [admin key]  
```  

## URI Parameters

| Parameter	  | Description  | 
|-------------|--------------|
| service name | Required. Set this to the unique, user-defined name of your search service. |
| index name  | Required. The request URI specifies the name of the index to delete.   |
| api-version | Required. The current stable version is `api-version=2020-06-30`. See [API versions](search-service-api-versions.md) for more versions.|
