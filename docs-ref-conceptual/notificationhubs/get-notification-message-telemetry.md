# Get notification message telemetry
This API provides additional telemetry on the finished states of outgoing push notifications. It is designed to help monitor push notifications sent from a hub. The Notification ID that this API uses can be retrieved from the HTTP Location header included in the response of the REST API used to send the notification.

This Per Message Telemetry feature is also available for [scheduled notifications](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/notification-hubs-send-scheduled-notifications/).

This API is only available for [Standard tier notification hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/notification-hubs/).

## Request
| Method | Request URI | HTTP version |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ | 
| GET | `https://{namespace}.servicebus.windows.net/{NotificationHub}/messages/{notification message ID}?api-version=2016-07` | HTTP/1.1 | 


## Request headers

The following table describes required and optional request headers.

| Request header | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- | 
| Authorization | Token generated as specified in Shared Access Signature Authentication with Service Bus, or Service Bus authentication and authorization with Microsoft Azure Active Directory Access Control (also known as Access Control Service or ACS). |
| x-ms-version | 2016-07 (Supported by 2015-01 or later) | 

## Request body

None.

## Response

The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers. Response body is returned on success.

## Response codes
| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- | 
| 200 | The message telemetry was retrieved successfully. Telemetry data may be a partial response, depending on the number of devices targeted by the notification message that was sent. |
| 400 | Message telemetry could not be retrieved because the request was malformed. |
| 401 | Authorization failure. The access key was incorrect. |
| 403 | Request rejected because this feature is not enabled for your SKU. Upgrade to Standard. |
| 404 | Telemetry does not exist. This may be because the notification ID is invalid or because the message has not progressed far enough in processing. If you receive a 404 code, wait and try again after 10 seconds. This state can continue for up to 30 minutes. | 

For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](/rest/api/storageservices/Common-REST-API-Error-Codes).

## Response body
The response body will be a NotificationDetails document consisting of the following elements.

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- | 
| NotificationId | The ID passed to the request that identifies the notification message. |
| Location | URI for the message |
| State | Indicates message progress. State may be one of the following values: <ul><li>**Abandoned**: Message processing has been abandoned. It will happen when the message could not be processed within the acceptable time window. By default, it's 30 minutes.</li><li>**Canceled**: This scheduled message was canceled by user.</li><li>**Completed**: Message processing has completed.</li><li>**Enqueued**: Message has been accepted but processing has not yet begun.</li><li>**NoTargetFound**: No devices were found to send this message.</li><li>**Processing**: Message processing has started.</li><li>**Scheduled**: Message is in queue and will be sent on the scheduled time.</li><li>**Unknown**: Message processing is in an unknown state.</li></ul> |

Here is an example telemetry from sending a notification to WNS:

```xml

  <Location>sb://{Your namespace}.servicebus.windows.net/{your hub name}/messages/{your message id}?api-version=2015-04</Location>
  <State>Completed</State>
  <EnqueueTime>2015-11-02T21:19:43Z</EnqueueTime>
  <StartTime>2015-11-02T21:19:43.9926996Z</StartTime>
  <EndTime>2015-11-02T21:19:43.9926996Z</EndTime>
  <NotificationBody>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?&gt;&lt;toast&gt;&lt;visual&gt;&lt;binding template="ToastText01"&gt;&lt;text id="1"&gt;Hello from a .NET App!&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/binding&gt;&lt;/visual&gt;&lt;/toast&gt;</NotificationBody>

    </Outcome>
  </WnsOutcomeCounts>
