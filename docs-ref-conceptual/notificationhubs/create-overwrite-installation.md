Note the following points: 

  - In JSON, the order of elements is not important.
  - Template body has to be JSON for APNS, GCM, ADM.
  - Template body must be XML for WNS and MPNS (except when raw).
  - Templates for WNS must include X-WNS-Type header.
  - Templates for MPNS must have compatible headers as mentioned in [Sending push notifications for Windows Phone 8](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-windows-mobile-push-notifications-mpns).

Some JSON examples follow.

Example to register with APNS:

``` json
{ 
    "installationId": "12234", 
    "tags": ["foo", "bar"], 
    "platform": "apns", 
    "pushChannel": "ABCDEF-123456-…" 
}  
```


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The Tags element is optional.</P>



Example to register natively with WNS including a template and no tags:

``` json
{ 
    "installationId": "12234", 
    "platform": "wns", 
    "pushChannel": "https://db3...", 
    "templates": { 
        "myTemplate" : { 
            body : '<toast><visual lang="en-US"><binding template="ToastTest01"><text id="1">$myTextProp1</text></binding></visual></tile>',
            headers: { "X-WNS-Type": "wns/toast" }, 
            "tags": ["foo", "bar"] 
            } 

        } 
}  
```
