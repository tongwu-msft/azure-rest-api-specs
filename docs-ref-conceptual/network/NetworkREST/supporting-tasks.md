A number of actions are possible to support your management of network resources.  
  
##  <a name="bk_common"></a> Common parameters and headers  
 The following information is common to all tasks:  
  
-   Replace {api-version} with 2016-03-30.  
  
-   Replace {subscription-id} with your subscription identifier in the URI.  
  
-   Set the Content-Type header to application/json.  
  
-   Set the Authorization header to a JSON Web Token that you obtain from Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Authenticating Azure Resource Manager requests](../Topic/Authenticating%20Azure%20Resource%20Manager%20requests.md).
