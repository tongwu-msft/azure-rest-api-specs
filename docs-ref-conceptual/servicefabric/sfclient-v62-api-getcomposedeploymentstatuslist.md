The continuation token parameter is used to obtain next set of results. A continuation token with a non empty value is included in the response of the API when the results from the system do not fit in a single response.

The results returned can be less than the specified maximum results if they do not fit in the message as per the max message size restrictions defined in the configuration. If this parameter is zero or not specified, the paged queries includes as many results as possible that fit in the return message.
