# Deploy Service Package To Node
Downloads all of the code packages associated with specified service manifest on the specified node.

This API provides a way to download code packages including the container images on a specific node outside of the normal application deployment and upgrade path. This is useful for the large code packages and container images to be present on the node before the actual application deployment and upgrade, thus significantly reducing the total time required for the deployment or upgrade.


## Request
| Method | Request URI |
| ------ | ----------- |
| POST | `/Nodes/{nodeName}/$/DeployServicePackage?api-version=6.0&timeout={timeout}` |


## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`nodeName`](#nodename) | string | Yes | Path |
| [`api-version`](#api-version) | string | Yes | Query |
| [`timeout`](#timeout) | integer (int64) | No | Query |
| [`DeployServicePackageToNodeDescription`](#deployservicepackagetonodedescription) | [DeployServicePackageToNodeDescription](sfclient-v62-model-deployservicepackagetonodedescription.md) | Yes | Body |

____
### `nodeName`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
The name of the node.

____
### `api-version`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
__Default__: `6.0` <br/>
<br/>
The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.

Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.


____
### `timeout`
__Type__: integer (int64) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
__Default__: `60` <br/>
__InclusiveMaximum__: `4294967295` <br/>
__InclusiveMinimum__: `1` <br/>
<br/>
The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.

____
### `DeployServicePackageToNodeDescription`
__Type__: [DeployServicePackageToNodeDescription](sfclient-v62-model-deployservicepackagetonodedescription.md) <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
Describes information for deploying a service package to a Service Fabric node.
