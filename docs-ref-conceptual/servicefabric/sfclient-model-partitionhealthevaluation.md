Represents health evaluation for a partition, containing information about the data and the algorithm used by health store to evaluate health. The evaluation is returned only when the aggregated health state is either Error or Warning.

## Properties
| Name | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Kind](#kind) | string | Yes |
| [AggregatedHealthState](#aggregatedhealthstate) | string (enum) | No |
| [Description](#description) | string | No |
| [PartitionId](#partitionid) | string (uuid) | No |
| [UnhealthyEvaluations](#unhealthyevaluations) | array of [HealthEvaluationWrapper](sfclient-model-healthevaluationwrapper.md) | No |

____
### Kind
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes <br/>
<br/>
A discriminator property. Its value must be 'Partition' for objects of type 'PartitionHealthEvaluation'.

____
### UnhealthyEvaluations
__Type__: array of [HealthEvaluationWrapper](sfclient-model-healthevaluationwrapper.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
