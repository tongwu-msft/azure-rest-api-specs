# NodeStatusFilter enum v80

type: string

Possible values include: 'default', 'all', 'up', 'down', 'enabling', 'disabling', 'disabled', 'unknown', 'removed'

Possible values are: 

  - `default` - This filter value will match all of the nodes excepts the ones with status as Unknown or Removed.
  - `all` - This filter value will match all of the nodes.
  - `up` - This filter value will match nodes that are Up.
  - `down` - This filter value will match nodes that are Down.
  - `enabling` - This filter value will match nodes that are in the process of being enabled with status as Enabling.
  - `disabling` - This filter value will match nodes that are in the process of being disabled with status as Disabling.
  - `disabled` - This filter value will match nodes that are Disabled.
  - `unknown` - This filter value will match nodes whose status is Unknown. A node would be in Unknown state if Service Fabric does not have authoritative information about that node. This can happen if the system learns about a node at runtime.
  - `removed` - This filter value will match nodes whose status is Removed. These are the nodes that are removed from the cluster using the RemoveNodeState API.
