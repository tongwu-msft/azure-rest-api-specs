# Disable Node
Deactivate a Service Fabric cluster node with the specified deactivation intent.

Deactivate a Service Fabric cluster node with the specified deactivation intent. Once the deactivation is in progress, the deactivation intent can be increased, but not decreased (for example, a node which is was deactivated with the Pause intent can be deactivated further with Restart, but not the other way around. Nodes may be reactivated using the Activate a node operation any time after they are deactivated. If the deactivation is not complete this will cancel the deactivation. A node which goes down and comes back up while deactivated will still need to be reactivated before services will be placed on that node.

____
### nodeName
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>

____
### api-version
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
__Default__: 6.0 <br/>
<br/>
The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be "6.0".

Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
