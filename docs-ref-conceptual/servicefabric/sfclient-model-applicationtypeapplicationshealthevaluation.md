# ApplicationTypeApplicationsHealthEvaluation

Represents health evaluation for applications of a particular application type. The application type applications evaluation can be returned when cluster health evaluation returns unhealthy aggregated health state, either Error or Warning. It contains health evaluations for each unhealthy application of the included application type that impacted current aggregated health state.

## Properties
| Name | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Kind](#kind) | string | Yes |
| [AggregatedHealthState](#aggregatedhealthstate) | string (enum) | No |
| [Description](#description) | string | No |
| [ApplicationTypeName](#applicationtypename) | string | No |
| [MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications](#maxpercentunhealthyapplications) | integer | No |
| [TotalCount](#totalcount) | integer (int64) | No |
| [UnhealthyEvaluations](#unhealthyevaluations) | array of [HealthEvaluationWrapper](sfclient-model-healthevaluationwrapper.md) | No |

____
### Kind
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes <br/>
<br/>
A discriminator property. Its value must be 'ApplicationTypeApplications' for objects of type 'ApplicationTypeApplicationsHealthEvaluation'.

____
### AggregatedHealthState
__Type__: string (enum) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The health state of a Service Fabric entity such as Cluster, Node, Application, Service, Partition, Replica etc.

  - Invalid - Indicates an invalid health state. All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.
  - Ok - Indicates the health state is okay. The value is 1.
  - Warning - Indicates the health state is at a warning level. The value is 2.
  - Error - Indicates the health state is at an error level. Error health state should be investigated, as they can impact the correct functionality of the cluster. The value is 3.

<br/>
Name of the application type.

____
### MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications
__Type__: integer <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications for the application type, specified as an entry in ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.

____
### TotalCount
__Type__: integer (int64) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Total number of applications of the application type found in the health store.

____
### UnhealthyEvaluations
__Type__: array of [HealthEvaluationWrapper](sfclient-model-healthevaluationwrapper.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
List of unhealthy evaluations that led to the aggregated health state. Includes all the unhealthy ApplicationHealthEvaluation of this application type that impacted the aggregated health.
