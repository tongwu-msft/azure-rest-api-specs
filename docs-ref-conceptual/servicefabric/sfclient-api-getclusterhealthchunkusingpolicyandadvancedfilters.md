# Get Cluster Health Chunk Using Policy And Advanced Filters
Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster using health chunks.

Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster using health chunks. The health evaluation is done based on the input cluster health chunk query description.
The query description allows users to specify health policies for evaluating the cluster and its children.
Users can specify very flexible filters to select which cluster entities to return. The selection can be done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy.
The query can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name, and for this application, return
only services that are in Error or Warning, and all partitions and replicas for one of these services.


## Request
| Method | Request URI |
| ------ | ----------- |
| POST | `/$/GetClusterHealthChunk?api-version=6.0&timeout={timeout}` |


## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [api-version](#api-version) | string | Yes | Query |
| [timeout](#timeout) | integer (int64) | No | Query |
| [ClusterHealthChunkQueryDescription](#clusterhealthchunkquerydescription) | [ClusterHealthChunkQueryDescription](sfclient-model-clusterhealthchunkquerydescription.md) | No | Body |

____
### api-version
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
__Default__: 6.0 <br/>
<br/>
The version of the API. This is a required parameter and it's value must be "6.0".

____
### timeout
__Type__: integer (int64) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
__Default__: 60 <br/>
__InclusiveMaximum__: 4294967295 <br/>
__InclusiveMinimum__: 1 <br/>
<br/>
The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.

____
### ClusterHealthChunkQueryDescription
__Type__: [ClusterHealthChunkQueryDescription](sfclient-model-clusterhealthchunkquerydescription.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Describes the cluster and application health policies used to evaluate the cluster health and the filters to select which cluster entities to be returned.
If the cluster health policy is present, it is used to evaluate the cluster events and the cluster nodes. If not present, the health evaluation uses the cluster health policy defined in the cluster manifest or the default cluster health policy.
By default, each application is evaluated using its specific application health policy, defined in the application manifest, or the default health policy, if no policy is defined in manifest.
If the application health policy map is specified, and it has an entry for an application, the specified application health policy
is used to evaluate the application health.
Users can specify very flexible filters to select which cluster entities to include in response. The selection can be done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy.
The query can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name, and for this application, return
only services that are in Error or Warning, and all partitions and replicas for one of these services.
