# PartitionDataLossProgress

Information about a partition data loss user-induced operation.

## Properties
| Name | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [State](#state) | string (enum) | No |
| [InvokeDataLossResult](#invokedatalossresult) | [InvokeDataLossResult](sfclient-v56-model-invokedatalossresult.md) | No |

____
### State
__Type__: string (enum) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
- Invalid - The operation state is invalid.
- Running - The operation is in progress.
- RollingBack -  The operation is rolling back internal system state because it encountered a fatal error or was cancelled by the user.  "RollingBack"
   does not refer to user state.  For example, if CancelOperation is called on a command of type PartitionDataLoss,
   a state of "RollingBack" does not mean service data is being restored (assuming the command has progressed far enough to cause data loss).  
   It means the system is rolling back/cleaning up internal system state associated with the command.
- Completed - The operation has completed successfully and is no longer running.
- Faulted - The operation has failed and is no longer running.
- Cancelled - The operation was cancelled by the user using CancelOperation, and is no longer running.
- ForceCancelled - The operation was cancelled by the user using CancelOperation, with the force parameter set to true.  It is no longer running.  Refer to CancelOperation for more details.

__Type__: [InvokeDataLossResult](sfclient-v56-model-invokedatalossresult.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
