# SingletonPartitionInformation

Information about a partition that is singleton. The services with singleton partitioning scheme are effectively non-partitioned. They only have one partition.

## Properties
| Name | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`ServicePartitionKind`](#servicepartitionkind) | string | Yes |
| [`Id`](#id) | string (uuid) | No |

____
### ServicePartitionKind
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes <br/>
<br/>
A discriminator property. Its value must be 'Singleton' for objects of type 'SingletonPartitionInformation'.

____
### `Id`
__Type__: string (uuid) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
An internal ID used by Service Fabric to uniquely identify a partition. This is a randomly generated GUID when the service was created. The partition ID is unique and does not change for the lifetime of the service. If the same service was deleted and recreated the IDs of its partitions would be different.
