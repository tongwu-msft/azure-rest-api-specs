| [`LastAppliedReplicationSequenceNumber`](#lastappliedreplicationsequencenumber) | string | No |
| [`IsInBuild`](#isinbuild) | boolean | No |
| [`LastReceivedCopySequenceNumber`](#lastreceivedcopysequencenumber) | string | No |

____
### `ReplicaId`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Represents the replica ID of the remote secondary replicator.

____
### `LastAcknowledgementProcessedTimeUtc`
__Type__: string (date-time) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The last timestamp (in UTC) when an acknowledgement from the secondary replicator was processed on the primary.
UTC 0 represents an invalid value, indicating that no acknowledgement messages were ever processed.


____
### `LastReceivedReplicationSequenceNumber`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The highest replication operation sequence number that the secondary has received from the primary.

____
### `LastAppliedReplicationSequenceNumber`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The highest replication operation sequence number that the secondary has applied to its state.

____
### `IsInBuild`
__Type__: boolean <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
A value that indicates whether the secondary replica is in the process of being built.

____
### `LastReceivedCopySequenceNumber`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The highest copy operation sequence number that the secondary has received from the primary.
A value of -1 implies that the secondary has received all copy operations.


____
### `LastAppliedCopySequenceNumber`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The highest copy operation sequence number that the secondary has applied to its state.
A value of -1 implies that the secondary has applied all copy operations and the copy process is complete.


____
### `RemoteReplicatorAcknowledgementStatus`
__Type__: [RemoteReplicatorAcknowledgementStatus](sfclient-v62-model-remotereplicatoracknowledgementstatus.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Represents the acknowledgment status for the remote secondary replicator.
