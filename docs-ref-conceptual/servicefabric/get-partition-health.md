# Get Partition Health
Gets the health of the specified Service Fabric partition.

Gets the health information of the specified partition.
Use EventsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of health events reported on the service based on the health state.
Use ReplicasHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of ReplicaHealthState objects on the partition.
If you specify a partition that does not exist in the health store, this cmdlet returns an error.


## Request
| Method | Request URI |
| ------ | ----------- |
| GET | `/Partitions/{partitionId}/$/GetHealth?api-version=3.0&EventsHealthStateFilter={EventsHealthStateFilter}&ReplicasHealthStateFilter={ReplicasHealthStateFilter}` |


## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [partitionId](#partitionid) | string (uuid) | Yes | Path |
| [api-version](#api-version) | string | Yes | Query |
| [EventsHealthStateFilter](#eventshealthstatefilter) | integer | No | Query |
| [ReplicasHealthStateFilter](#replicashealthstatefilter) | integer | No | Query |

____
### partitionId
__Type__: string (uuid) <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
The identity of the partition.

____
### api-version
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
__Default__: 3.0 <br/>

### EventsHealthStateFilter
__Type__: integer <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
__Default__: 0 <br/>
<br/>
Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent objects returned based on health state.
The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states.
Only events that match the filter are returned. All events are used to evaluate the aggregated health state.
If not specified, all entries are returned. The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the provided value is 6 then all of the events with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.
  
- Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero. 
- None - Filter that doesn’t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1. 
- Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2. 
- Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4. 
- Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8. 
- All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535. 


____
### ReplicasHealthStateFilter
__Type__: integer <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
__Default__: 0 <br/>
<br/>
Allows filtering the collection of ReplicaHealthState objects on the partition. The value can be obtained from members or bitwise operations on members of HealthStateFilter. Only replicas that match the filter will be returned. All replicas will be used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries will be returned.The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
