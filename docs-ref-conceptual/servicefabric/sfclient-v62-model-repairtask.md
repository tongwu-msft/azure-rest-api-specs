____
### `TaskId`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
The ID of the repair task.

____
### `Version`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The version of the repair task.
When creating a new repair task, the version must be set to zero.  When updating a repair task,
the version is used for optimistic concurrency checks.  If the version is
set to zero, the update will not check for write conflicts.  If the version is set to a non-zero value, then the
update will only succeed if the actual current version of the repair task matches this value.


____
### `Description`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
A description of the purpose of the repair task, or other informational details.
May be set when the repair task is created, and is immutable once set.


____
### `State`
__Type__: string (enum) <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
The workflow state of the repair task. Valid initial states are Created, Claimed, and Preparing.



Possible values are: 

  - `Invalid` - Indicates that the repair task state is invalid. All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid value.
  - `Created` - Indicates that the repair task has been created.
  - `Claimed` - Indicates that the repair task has been claimed by a repair executor.
  - `Preparing` - Indicates that the Repair Manager is preparing the system to handle the impact of the repair task, usually by taking resources offline gracefully.
  - `Approved` - Indicates that the repair task has been approved by the Repair Manager and is safe to execute.
  - `Executing` - Indicates that execution of the repair task is in progress.
  - `Restoring` - Indicates that the Repair Manager is restoring the system to its pre-repair state, usually by bringing resources back online.
  - `Completed` - Indicates that the repair task has completed, and no further state changes will occur.



____
### `Flags`
__Type__: integer <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
A bitwise-OR of the following values, which gives additional details about the status of the repair task.
- 1 - Cancellation of the repair has been requested
- 2 - Abort of the repair has been requested
- 4 - Approval of the repair was forced via client request


____
### `Action`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
The requested repair action. Must be specified when the repair task is created, and is immutable once set.


____
### `Target`
__Type__: [RepairTargetDescriptionBase](sfclient-v62-model-repairtargetdescriptionbase.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The target object determines what actions the system will take to prepare for the impact of the repair, prior to approving execution of the repair.
May be set when the repair task is created, and is immutable once set.


____
### `Executor`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The name of the repair executor. Must be specified in Claimed and later states, and is immutable once set.

____
### `ExecutorData`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
A data string that the repair executor can use to store its internal state.

____
### `Impact`
__Type__: [RepairImpactDescriptionBase](sfclient-v62-model-repairimpactdescriptionbase.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The impact object determines what actions the system will take to prepare for the impact of the repair, prior to approving execution of the repair.
Impact must be specified by the repair executor when transitioning to the Preparing state, and is immutable once set.


____
### `ResultStatus`
__Type__: string (enum) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
A value describing the overall result of the repair task execution. Must be specified in the Restoring and later states, and is immutable once set.

__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The workflow state of the health check when the repair task is in the Preparing state.
