# Enable Service Backup
Enables periodic backup of stateful partitions under this Service Fabric service.

Enables periodic backup of stateful partitions which are part of this Service Fabric service. Each partition is backed up individually as per the specified backup policy description. In case the application, which the service is part of, is already enabled for backup then this operation would override the policy being used to take the periodic backup for this service and its partitions (unless explicitly overridden at the partition level).
Note only C# based Reliable Actor and Reliable Stateful services are currently supported for periodic backup.


## Request
| Method | Request URI |
| ------ | ----------- |
| POST | `/Services/{serviceId}/$/EnableBackup?api-version=6.4&timeout={timeout}` |


## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`serviceId`](#serviceid) | string | Yes | Path |
| [`api-version`](#api-version) | string | Yes | Query |
| [`timeout`](#timeout) | integer (int64) | No | Query |
| [`EnableBackupDescription`](#enablebackupdescription) | [EnableBackupDescription](sfclient-model-enablebackupdescription.md) | Yes | Body |

____
### `serviceId`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
The identity of the service. This ID is typically the full name of the service without the 'fabric:' URI scheme.
Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the "~" character.
For example, if the service name is "fabric:/myapp/app1/svc1", the service identity would be "myapp~app1~svc1" in 6.0+ and "myapp/app1/svc1" in previous versions.


____
### `api-version`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
__Default__: `6.4` <br/>
<br/>
The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.4'.

Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This version is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

Additionally the runtime accepts any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0 and the runtime is 6.1, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.


____
### `timeout`
__Type__: integer (int64) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
__Default__: `60` <br/>
__InclusiveMaximum__: `4294967295` <br/>
__InclusiveMinimum__: `1` <br/>
<br/>
The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.

____
### `EnableBackupDescription`
__Type__: [EnableBackupDescription](sfclient-model-enablebackupdescription.md) <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
Specifies the parameters for enabling backup.
