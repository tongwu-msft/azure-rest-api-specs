# ReconfigurationType enum

type: string

The type of reconfiguration for replica of a stateful service.

Possible values are: 

  - `Unknown` - Indicates the invalid reconfiguration type.
  - `SwapPrimary` - Specifies that the primary replica is being swapped with a different replica.
  - `Failover` - Reconfiguration triggered in response to a primary going down. This could be due to many reasons such as primary replica crashing etc.
  - `Other` - Reconfigurations where the primary replica is not changing.
