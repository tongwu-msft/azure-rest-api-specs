| Name | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`HealthState`](#healthstate) | string (enum) | No |
| [`NodeHealthStateChunks`](#nodehealthstatechunks) | [NodeHealthStateChunkList](sfclient-v62-model-nodehealthstatechunklist.md) | No |
| [`ApplicationHealthStateChunks`](#applicationhealthstatechunks) | [ApplicationHealthStateChunkList](sfclient-v62-model-applicationhealthstatechunklist.md) | No |

### `HealthState`
__Type__: string (enum) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The HealthState representing the aggregated health state of the cluster computed by Health Manager.

The health state of a Service Fabric entity such as Cluster, Node, Application, Service, Partition, Replica etc.

  - `Invalid` - Indicates an invalid health state. All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.
  - `Ok` - Indicates the health state is okay. The value is 1.
  - `Warning` - Indicates the health state is at a warning level. The value is 2.
  - `Error` - Indicates the health state is at an error level. Error health state should be investigated, as they can impact the correct functionality of the cluster. The value is 3.
  - `Unknown` - Indicates an unknown health status. The value is 65535.

### `NodeHealthStateChunks`
__Type__: [NodeHealthStateChunkList](sfclient-v62-model-nodehealthstatechunklist.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The list of node health state chunks in the cluster that respect the filters in the cluster health chunk query description.


____
### `ApplicationHealthStateChunks`
__Type__: [ApplicationHealthStateChunkList](sfclient-v62-model-applicationhealthstatechunklist.md) <br/>
