____
### ServiceKind
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes <br/>
<br/>
A discriminator property. Its value must be 'Stateful' for objects of type 'DeployedStatefulServiceReplicaInfo'.

____
### ServiceName
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Full hierarchical name of the service in URI format starting with `fabric:`.

____
### ServiceTypeName
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Name of the service type as specified in the service manifest.

____
### ServiceManifestName
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The name of the service manifest in which this service type is defined.

____
### CodePackageName
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The name of the code package that hosts this replica.

____
### PartitionID
__Type__: string (uuid) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
An internal ID used by Service Fabric to uniquely identify a partition. This is a randomly generated GUID when the service was created. The partition id is unique and does not change for the lifetime of the service. If the same service was deleted and recreated the ids of its partitions would be different.

____
### ReplicaStatus
__Type__: string (enum) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The status of a replica of a service. Possible values are following.

  -Invalid - Indicates the replica status is invalid. All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.
  -InBuild - The replica is being built. This means that a primary replica is seeding this replica. The value is 1.
  -Standby - The replica is in standby. The value is 2.
  -Ready - The replica is ready. The value is 3.
  -Down - The replica is down. The value is 4.
  -Dropped - Replica is dropped. This means that the replica has been removed from the replica set. If it is persisted, its state has been deleted. The value is 5.


____
### Address
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The last address returned by the replica in Open or ChangeRole.

____
### ServicePackageActivationId
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The ActivationId of a deployed service package. If ServicePackageActivationMode specified at the time of creating the service
is 'SharedProcess' (or if it is not specified, in which case it defaults to 'SharedProcess'), then value of ServicePackageActivationId
is always an empty string.


____
### ReplicaId
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Id of the stateful service replica.

____
### ReplicaRole
__Type__: string (enum) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The role of a replica of a stateful service. Possible values are following.
  - Unknown - Indicates the initial role that a replica is created in. The value is zero.
  - None - Specifies that the replica has no responsibility in regard to the replica set. The value is 1
  - Primary - Refers to the replica in the set on which all read and write operations are complete in order to enforce strong consistency semantics. Read operations are handled directly by the Primary replica, while write operations must be acknowledged by a quorum of the replicas in the replica set. There can only be one Primary replica in a replica set at a time. The value is 2.
  - IdleSecondary - Refers to a replica in the set that receives a state transfer from the Primary replica to prepare for becoming an active Secondary replica. There can be multiple Idle Secondary replicas in a replica set at a time. Idle Secondary replicas do not count as a part of a write quorum. The value is 3.
  - ActiveSecondary - Refers to a replica in the set that receives state updates from the Primary replica, applies them, and sends acknowledgements back. Secondary replicas must participate in the write quorum for a replica set. There can be multiple active Secondary replicas in a replica set at a time. The number of active Secondary replicas is configurable that the reliability subsystem should maintain. The value is 4.
