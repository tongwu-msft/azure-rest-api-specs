# Backup Partition
Triggers backup of the partition's state.

Creates a backup of the stateful persisted partition's state. In case the partition is already being periodically backed up, then by default the new backup is created at the same backup storage. One can also override the same by specifying the backup storage details as part of the request body. Once the backup is initiated, its progress can be tracked using the GetBackupProgress operation. 
In case, the operation times out, specify a greater backup timeout value in the query parameter.


## Request
| Method | Request URI |
| ------ | ----------- |
| POST | `/Partitions/{partitionId}/$/Backup?BackupTimeout={BackupTimeout}&api-version=6.2-preview&timeout={timeout}` |


## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`partitionId`](#partitionid) | string (uuid) | Yes | Path |
| [`BackupTimeout`](#backuptimeout) | integer | No | Query |
| [`api-version`](#api-version) | string | Yes | Query |
| [`timeout`](#timeout) | integer (int64) | No | Query |
| [`BackupPartitionDescription`](#backuppartitiondescription) | [BackupPartitionDescription](sfclient-v62-model-backuppartitiondescription.md) | No | Body |

____
### `partitionId`
__Type__: string (uuid) <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
The identity of the partition.

____
### `BackupTimeout`
__Type__: integer <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
__Default__: `10` <br/>
<br/>
Specifies the maximum amount of time, in minutes, to wait for the backup operation to complete. Post that, the operation completes with timeout error. However, in certain corner cases it could be that though the operation returns back timeout, the backup actually goes through. In case of timeout error, its recommended to invoke this operation again with a greater timeout value. The default value for the same is 10 minutes.

____
### `api-version`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
__Default__: `6.2-preview` <br/>
<br/>
The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.2-preview'.


____
### `timeout`
__Type__: integer (int64) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
__Default__: `60` <br/>
__InclusiveMaximum__: `4294967295` <br/>
__InclusiveMinimum__: `1` <br/>
<br/>
The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.

____
### `BackupPartitionDescription`
__Type__: [BackupPartitionDescription](sfclient-v62-model-backuppartitiondescription.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Describes the parameters to backup the partition now. If not present, backup operation uses default parameters from the backup policy current associated with this partition.

## Responses

| HTTP Status Code | Description | Response Schema |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 202 (Accepted) | A 202 status code indicates the operation request was accepted and backup will be initiated. Use GetPartitionBackupProgress operation to get the status of the backup operation.<br/> |  |
| All other status codes | The detailed error response.<br/> | [FabricError](sfclient-v62-model-fabricerror.md) |

## Examples
