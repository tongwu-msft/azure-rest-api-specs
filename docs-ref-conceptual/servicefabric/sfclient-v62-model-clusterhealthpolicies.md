### `ApplicationHealthPolicyMap`
__Type__: array of [ApplicationHealthPolicyMapItem](sfclient-v62-model-applicationhealthpolicymapitem.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>

Defines a map that contains specific application health policies for different applications.
Each entry specifies as key the application name and as value an ApplicationHealthPolicy used to evaluate the application health.

The map is empty by default.
