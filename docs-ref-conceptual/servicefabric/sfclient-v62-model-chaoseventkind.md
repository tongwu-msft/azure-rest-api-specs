# ChaosEventKind enum

type: string

The kind of Chaos event.


Possible values are: 

  - `Invalid` - Indicates an invalid Chaos event kind. All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid type.
  - `Started` - Indicates a Chaos event that gets generated when Chaos is started.
  - `ExecutingFaults` - Indicates a Chaos event that gets generated when Chaos has decided on the faults for an iteration. This Chaos event contains the details of the faults as a list of strings.
  - `Waiting` - Indicates a Chaos event that gets generated when Chaos is waiting for the cluster to become ready for faulting, for example, Chaos may be waiting for the on-going upgrade to finish.
  - `ValidationFailed` - Indicates a Chaos event that gets generated when the cluster entities do not become stable and healthy within ChaosParameters.MaxClusterStabilizationTimeoutInSeconds.
  - `TestError` - Indicates a Chaos event that gets generated when an unexpected event has occurred in the Chaos engine, for example, due to the cluster snapshot being inconsistent, while faulting a faultable entity Chaos found that the entity was already faulted.
  - `Stopped` - Indicates a Chaos event that gets generated when Chaos stops because either the user issued a stop or the time to run was up.
