# Service Fabric Client REST API Reference v8.1

[Service Fabric](https://aka.ms/ServiceFabric) is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices. 

Service Fabric Client APIs allow deploying and managing microservices based applications and containers in a Service Fabric cluster on Azure, on-premise, on local development machine or in other cloud. This document provides a reference for these APIs.


> [!IMPORTANT]
>  These APIs work with Service Fabric clusters running runtime version 8.1.0.46 and above.
>

## Versioning
The REST APIs are versioned using the api-version query parameter in the URI.
All the REST APIs will always support api-version=MajorVersion.MinorVersion where the Major and Minor version number correspond to the version of the Service Fabric cluster runtime being targeted. 
For instance, while sending requests to a 6.0 cluster, api-version=6.0 is always guaranteed to work, with the latest contract supported by the REST API.
However, requests with api-version=6.0 will fail against a 5.5 cluster.
To maintain backward compatibility, the cluster will always support any previously supported api-version. So requests with api-version=1.0 or 2.0 or 3.0 will succeed against a 6.0 cluster. The response output will depend on the contract specified for the specific api-version.



## Protocol
All task operations conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification. All task operations return standard HTTP status codes and may also return additional [Status and Error Codes](sfclient-status-and-error-codes.md) in the response body. See [Service Fabric Names and JSON Serialization](sfclient-service-fabric-names-and-json-serialization.md) for special considerations when serializing and de-serializing names and identities of various entities such as nodes, applications, services, partitions, and replicas in the Service Fabric cluster, to and from request and response. It is recommended that you secure request and responses. For more information, see [Authenticating Service Fabric REST Requests](sfclient-authenticating-service-fabric-rest-requests.md). 


## Connection
 To connect to the local development cluster, you must use the correct URI with the correct client connection port, identified by {connection-port} in the URIs listed below. The client connection port is specified by HttpGatewayEndpoint in the cluster manifest file.  
  
 Though the examples show http, both http and https protocols are supported by Service Fabric. The protocol is specified by HttpGatewayEndpoint in the cluster manifest file.  
  
 To connect to the local development cluster, use the following URI:  
  
```  
http://localhost:{connection-port}  
```  
  
 To connect to a cluster by fully qualified domain name, use a URI similar to the following URI.  
  
```  
http://MyCluster.cloudapp.net:{connection-port}  
```  
  
 To connect to a cluster by IP address, use a URI similar to the following URI.  
  
```  
http://65.52.117.43:{connection-port}  

```
