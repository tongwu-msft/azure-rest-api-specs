# ReplicasHealthEvaluation

Represents health evaluation for replicas, containing health evaluations for each unhealthy replica that impacted current aggregated health state. Can be returned when evaluating partition health and the aggregated health state is either Error or Warning.

## Properties
| Name | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Kind](#kind) | string | Yes |
| [AggregatedHealthState](#aggregatedhealthstate) | string (enum) | No |
| [Description](#description) | string | No |
| [MaxPercentUnhealthyReplicasPerPartition](#maxpercentunhealthyreplicasperpartition) | integer | No |
| [TotalCount](#totalcount) | integer (int64) | No |
| [UnhealthyEvaluations](#unhealthyevaluations) | array of [HealthEvaluationWrapper](sfclient-model-healthevaluationwrapper.md) | No |

____
### Kind
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes <br/>
<br/>
A discriminator property. Its value must be 'Replicas' for objects of type 'ReplicasHealthEvaluation'.

____
### AggregatedHealthState
__Type__: string (enum) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The health state of a Service Fabric entity such as Cluster, Node, Application, Service, Partition, Replica etc.

  - Invalid - Indicates an invalid health state. All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.
  - Ok - Indicates the health state is okay. The value is 1.
  - Warning - Indicates the health state is at a warning level. The value is 2.
  - Error - Indicates the health state is at an error level. Error health state should be investigated, as they can impact the correct functionality of the cluster. The value is 3.
  - Unknown - Indicates an unknown health status. The value is 65535.


____
### Description
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Description of the health evaluation, which represents a summary of the evaluation process.

____
### MaxPercentUnhealthyReplicasPerPartition
__Type__: integer <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy replicas per partition from the ApplicationHealthPolicy.

____
### TotalCount
__Type__: integer (int64) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Total number of replicas in the partition from the health store.

____
### UnhealthyEvaluations
__Type__: array of [HealthEvaluationWrapper](sfclient-model-healthevaluationwrapper.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
List of unhealthy evaluations that led to the aggregated health state. Includes all the unhealthy ReplicaHealthEvaluation that impacted the aggregated health.
