# Commit Image Store Upload Session
Commit an image store upload session.

When all file chunks have been uploaded, the upload session needs to be committed explicitly to complete the upload. Image store preserves the upload session until the expiration time, which is 30 minutes after the last chunk received. 


## Request
| Method | Request URI |
| ------ | ----------- |
| POST | `/ImageStore/$/CommitUploadSession?api-version=6.0&session-id={session-id}&timeout={timeout}` |


## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`api-version`](#api-version) | string | Yes | Query |
| [`session-id`](#session-id) | string (uuid) | Yes | Query |
| [`timeout`](#timeout) | integer (int64) | No | Query |

____
### `api-version`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
__Default__: `6.0` <br/>
<br/>
The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.

Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.


____
### `session-id`
__Type__: string (uuid) <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
A GUID generated by the user for a file uploading. It identifies an image store upload session which keeps track of all file chunks until it is committed.

____
### `timeout`
__Type__: integer (int64) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
__Default__: `60` <br/>
__InclusiveMaximum__: `4294967295` <br/>
__InclusiveMinimum__: `1` <br/>
<br/>
The server timeout for performing the operation in seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this parameter is 60 seconds.

## Responses

| HTTP Status Code | Description | Response Schema |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 (OK) | If the commit request succeeds, the server returns the HTTP 200 OK status code.<br/> |  |
| All other status codes | The detailed error response.<br/> | [FabricError](sfclient-v62-model-fabricerror.md) |
