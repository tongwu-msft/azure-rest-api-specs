# ReplicaHealthEvaluation

Represents health evaluation for a replica, containing information about the data and the algorithm used by health store to evaluate health. The evaluation is returned only when the aggregated health state is either Error or Warning.

## Properties
| Name | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Kind](#kind) | string | Yes |
| [AggregatedHealthState](#aggregatedhealthstate) | string (enum) | No |
| [Description](#description) | string | No |
| [PartitionId](#partitionid) | string (uuid) | No |
| [ReplicaOrInstanceId](#replicaorinstanceid) | string (int64) | No |
| [UnhealthyEvaluations](#unhealthyevaluations) | array of [HealthEvaluationWrapper](sfclient-model-healthevaluationwrapper.md) | No |

____
### Kind
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes <br/>
<br/>
A discriminator property. Its value must be 'Replica' for objects of type 'ReplicaHealthEvaluation'.

____
### AggregatedHealthState
__Type__: string (enum) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The health state of a Service Fabric entity such as Cluster, Node, Application, Service, Partition, Replica etc.

  - Invalid - Indicates an invalid health state. All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.
  - Ok - Indicates the health state is okay. The value is 1.
  - Warning - Indicates the health state is at a warning level. The value is 2.
  - Error - Indicates the health state is at an error level. Error health state should be investigated, as they can impact the correct functionality of the cluster. The value is 3.
  - Unknown - Indicates an unknown health status. The value is 65535.


____
### Description
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Description of the health evaluation, which represents a summary of the evaluation process.

____
### PartitionId
__Type__: string (uuid) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Id of the partition to which the replica belongs.

____
### ReplicaOrInstanceId
__Type__: string (int64) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Id of the stateful service replica or the stateless service instance.

____
### UnhealthyEvaluations
__Type__: array of [HealthEvaluationWrapper](sfclient-model-healthevaluationwrapper.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
List of unhealthy evaluations that led to the current aggregated health state of the replica. The types of the unhealthy evaluations can be EventHealthEvaluation.
