# Get Provisioned Fabric Code Version Info List
Gets a list of fabric code versions that are provisioned in a Service Fabric cluster.

Gets a list of information about fabric code versions that are provisioned in the cluster. The parameter CodeVersion can be used to optionally filter the output to only that particular version.

## Request
| Method | Request URI |
| ------ | ----------- |
| GET | `/$/GetProvisionedCodeVersions?api-version=6.0&CodeVersion={CodeVersion}&timeout={timeout}` |


## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`api-version`](#api-version) | string | Yes | Query |
| [`CodeVersion`](#codeversion) | string | No | Query |
| [`timeout`](#timeout) | integer (int64) | No | Query |

____
### `api-version`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
__Default__: `6.0` <br/>
<br/>
The version of the API. This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.

Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
