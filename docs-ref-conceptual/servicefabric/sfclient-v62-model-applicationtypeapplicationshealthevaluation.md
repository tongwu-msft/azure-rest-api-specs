# ApplicationTypeApplicationsHealthEvaluation

Represents health evaluation for applications of a particular application type. The application type applications evaluation can be returned when cluster health evaluation returns unhealthy aggregated health state, either Error or Warning. It contains health evaluations for each unhealthy application of the included application type that impacted current aggregated health state.

## Properties

| --- | --- | --- |
| [`Kind`](#kind) | string | Yes |
| [`AggregatedHealthState`](#aggregatedhealthstate) | string (enum) | No |
| [`Description`](#description) | string | No |
| [`ApplicationTypeName`](#applicationtypename) | string | No |
| [`MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications`](#maxpercentunhealthyapplications) | integer | No |

____
### Kind
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes <br/>
<br/>
A discriminator property. Its value must be 'ApplicationTypeApplications' for objects of type 'ApplicationTypeApplicationsHealthEvaluation'.

____
### `AggregatedHealthState`
__Type__: string (enum) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>


The health state of a Service Fabric entity such as Cluster, Node, Application, Service, Partition, Replica etc.

Possible values are: 

  - `Invalid` - Indicates an invalid health state. All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.
  - `Ok` - Indicates the health state is okay. The value is 1.
  - `Warning` - Indicates the health state is at a warning level. The value is 2.
  - `Error` - Indicates the health state is at an error level. Error health state should be investigated, as they can impact the correct functionality of the cluster. The value is 3.
  - `Unknown` - Indicates an unknown health status. The value is 65535.



____
### `Description`
__Type__: string <br/>

<br/>
Description of the health evaluation, which represents a summary of the evaluation process.

____
### `ApplicationTypeName`
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The application type name as defined in the application manifest.

____
### `MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications`
__Type__: integer <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications for the application type, specified as an entry in ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.

____
### `TotalCount`
__Type__: integer (int64) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Total number of applications of the application type found in the health store.

____
### `UnhealthyEvaluations`
__Type__: array of [HealthEvaluationWrapper](sfclient-v62-model-healthevaluationwrapper.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
List of unhealthy evaluations that led to the aggregated health state. Includes all the unhealthy ApplicationHealthEvaluation of this application type that impacted the aggregated health.
