# PartitionAccessStatus enum

type: string

Specifies the access status of the partition.

Possible values are: 

  - `Invalid` - Indicates that the read or write operation access status is not valid. This value is not returned to the caller.
  - `Granted` - Indicates that the read or write operation access is granted and the operation is allowed.
  - `ReconfigurationPending` - Indicates that the client should try again later, because a reconfiguration is in progress.
  - `NotPrimary` - Indicates that this client request was received by a replica that is not a Primary replica.
  - `NoWriteQuorum` - Indicates that no write quorum is available and, therefore, no write operation can be accepted.
