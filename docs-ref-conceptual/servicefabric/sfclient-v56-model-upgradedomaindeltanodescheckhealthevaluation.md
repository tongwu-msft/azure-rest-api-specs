# UpgradeDomainDeltaNodesCheckHealthEvaluation

Represents health evaluation for delta unhealthy cluster nodes in an upgrade domain, containing health evaluations for each unhealthy node that impacted current aggregated health state.
Can be returned during cluster upgrade when cluster aggregated health state is Warning or Error.

____
### Kind
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes <br/>
<br/>
A discriminator property. Its value must be 'UpgradeDomainDeltaNodesCheck' for objects of type 'UpgradeDomainDeltaNodesCheckHealthEvaluation'.

____
### AggregatedHealthState
__Type__: string (enum) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
The health state of a Service Fabric entity such as Cluster, Node, Application, Service, Partition, Replica etc.

  - Invalid - Indicates an invalid health state. All Service Fabric enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.
  - Ok - Indicates the health state is okay. The value is 1.
  - Warning - Indicates the health state is at a warning level. The value is 2.
  - Error - Indicates the health state is at an error level. Error health state should be investigated, as they can impact the correct functionality of the cluster. The value is 3.
  - Unknown - Indicates an unknown health status. The value is 65535.


____
