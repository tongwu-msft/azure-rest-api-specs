____
### ServiceKind
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes <br/>
<br/>
A discriminator property. Its value must be 'Stateless' for objects of type 'StatelessServiceInstanceHealth'.

__Type__: [HealthStatistics](sfclient-model-healthstatistics.md) <br/>
__Required__: No<br/>
<br/>
Shows the health statistics for all children types of the queried entity.

____
### PartitionId
__Type__: string (uuid) <br/>
