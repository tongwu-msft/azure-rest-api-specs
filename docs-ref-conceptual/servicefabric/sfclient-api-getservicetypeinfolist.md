# Get Service Type Info List
Gets the list containing the information about service types that are supported by a provisioned application type in a Service Fabric cluster.

Gets the list containing the information about service types that are supported by a provisioned application type in a Service Fabric cluster. The response includes the name of the service type, the name and version of the service manifest the type is defined in, kind (stateless or stateless) of the service type and other information about it.

## Request
| Method | Request URI |
| ------ | ----------- |
| GET | `/ApplicationTypes/{applicationTypeName}/$/GetServiceTypes?api-version=6.0&ApplicationTypeVersion={ApplicationTypeVersion}&timeout={timeout}` |


## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [applicationTypeName](#applicationtypename) | string | Yes | Path |
| [api-version](#api-version) | string | Yes | Query |
| [ApplicationTypeVersion](#applicationtypeversion) | string | Yes | Query |
| [timeout](#timeout) | integer (int64) | No | Query |

____
### applicationTypeName
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
<br/>
The name of the application type.

____
### api-version
__Type__: string <br/>
__Required__: Yes<br/>
__Default__: 6.0 <br/>
<br/>
The version of this API. This is a required parameter and its value must be "6.0".

Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.

Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.
