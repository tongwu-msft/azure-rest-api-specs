# Azure Machine Learning Studio Management REST APIs

The following Azure Machine Learning Studio REST APIs enable you to create and manage:

- **Machine Learning Studio commitment plans and associations**

- **Azure Resource Manager based web services** - Azure Machine Learning Studio enables you to build and test a predictive analytics solution, and then deploy it as an Azure web service. 
For an overview of the process, see [Azure Machine Learning Studio Web Services: Deployment and consumption](/azure/machine-learning/studio/deploy-consume-web-service-guide).


## REST Operation Groups

| Operation Group | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
|  [Commitment Associations](/rest/api/machinelearning/commitmentassociations) | Provides operations that allow you to manage commitment associations. |
|  [Commitment Plans](/rest/api/machinelearning/commitmentplans) | Provides operations that allow you to create and manage commitment plans. |
|  [Commitment Plans Usage History](/rest/api/machinelearning/usagehistory) | Provides an operation that allow you to retrieve commitment plan usage history. |
|  [Web Services](/rest/api/machinelearning/webservices) | Provides operations that allow you to create and manage web services. |

## Common parameters and headers

The following information is common to tasks related to these APIs:

- The host URI for Machine Learning Studio REST APIs is **https://management.azure.com/**
- Replace `{subscription-id}` with your subscription identifier in the URI
- Replace `{resource-group-name}` with the resource group name
- Set the Content-Type header to **application/json**
- Set the Authorization header to a JSON Web Token that you obtain from Azure Active Directory <!-- This topic doesn't exist anymore: (for more information, see [Authenticating Azure Resource Manager requests](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790557.aspx))-->
