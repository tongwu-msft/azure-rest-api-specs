# Overview

## What is Azure FarmBeats?

Azure FarmBeats is a business-to-business offering available as a resource provider in Azure. Azure FarmBeats will allow youâ€¯to acquire, aggregate, and process agricultural data from various sources (farm equipment manufacturers, weather, satellite, sensor, drone, etc.) to build intelligent digital agriculture solutions. By using Azure FarmBeats, agriculture businesses can focus on core value-adds instead of the undifferentiated heavy lifting of data engineering. Azure FarmBeats enables users to query and reason through data present in standardized schemas coming from different sources in a consistent way, fuse data between data sources, and generate insights by rapidly training and building Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning models across data sets.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure FarmBeats is currently in private preview. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/). Azure FarmBeats is provided without a service level agreement. Write to us at FarmBeatsSupport@microsoft.com for any queries.


### Azure FarmBeats - IaaS vs PaaS?
Previsouly, Azure FarmBeats was a IaaS offering in Azure market place (in public preview). Based on the experience with IaaS offering and customer feedback, FarmBeats is rearchitectured as a PaaS offering. This helps Azure to add value to customers faster and respond better to customer needs. 
&nbsp;

Going forward, usage of IaaS offering is discouraged. Users on IaaS version can continue to use it. However, the same would be deprecated after some time. Hence, unless customers have specific need to be on IaaS (for example support for sensor integration is not yet available with PaaS), they are requested to move to PaaS to experience superior product capabilities.
