# What is Azure FarmBeats?

Azure FarmBeats is a fully managed service that enables youâ€¯to acquire, aggregate, and process agricultural data from various sources like farm operations, weather, satellite, sensor, and so on, to build digital agriculture solutions. By using Azure FarmBeats, agriculture businesses can focus on core value-adds instead of the undifferentiated heavy lifting of data engineering. Azure FarmBeats enables you to query and reason through data, present in standardized schemas in a consistent way. FarmBeats also enables users to fuse data between data sources, and generate insights by rapidly training and building AI/ML models across data sets.
