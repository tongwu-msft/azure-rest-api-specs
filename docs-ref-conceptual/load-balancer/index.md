# Load Balancer REST API

Load balancer allows fine-grained configuration of how incoming traffic is distributed across VM instances hosted in Microsoft Azure. A load balancer has two main parts: a frontend and a backend configuration. The frontend configuration describes the exposed IP address of the load balancer. The frontend IP address of a load balancer can be a public or private IP address. The backend configuration of a load balancer describes how the traffic is distributed across VM instances and how health of a particular VM instance is determined.  For a more detailed overview see the [Azure Load Balancer product page](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-balancer).
