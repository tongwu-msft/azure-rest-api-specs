# Azure Synapse Analytics REST API
 
Use the Azure Synapse Analytics REST APIs to create and manage Azure Synapse resources through Azure Resource Manager and Azure Synapse endpoints. All task operations conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification and most operations return an `x-ms-request-id` header that can be used to obtain information about the request. You must make sure that requests made to these resources are secure, using `https`. For more information on making secure requests, see [Acquire an access token](/rest/api/azure/#acquire-an-access-token).
