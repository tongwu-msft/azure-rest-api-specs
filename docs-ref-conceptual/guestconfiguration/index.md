Guest Configuration definitions in Azure Policy allow you to validate settings inside virtual
machines. This includes the configuration of the Operating System, applications, or even
environmental data. You can use this API to create or update Guest Configuration, and get
information about the compliance details of a virtual machine including which specific settings are
not compliant with the assigned configuration.
