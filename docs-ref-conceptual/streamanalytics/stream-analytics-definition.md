# Definition

## Retrieve Default Definition (Azure Stream Analytics)
  Takes programmatically queryable interface for a UDF binding and returns the default function definition. This definition can then be used to create the UDF. This endpoint helps user to construct the initial UDF definition which they can later change according to their requirements if needed.  
  
### Request  
 The **Retrieve Default Definition Function** request is specified as follows.  
  
 For headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to Stream Analytics jobs, see [Common parameters and headers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/8d088ecc-26eb-42e9-8acc-fe929ed33563). You must make sure that the request that is made to the management service is secure.
