# Input

ASA service will attempt to get sample events for a limited time, if there are no events in the source when it queries it would not wait, it would return zero events. ASA service will only spend a fixed amount of time to get sample events, it would return as many events as it could read within the limited time. Please note that this is a sample set of events, the order the events are received in the sample and the order the events are processed can be different.

|Element name|Required|Notes|  
|------------------|--------------|-----------|  
|**type**|Yes|Indicates whether the input is a source of type reference data or stream data. After an input is created, its type cannot be changed (PUT or PATCH). You must delete the input and create a new one.|  
|**serialization**|Yes|Describes how data from this input is serialized. Allowed **serialization** type values are specific to the type of serialization used.|  
|**datasource**|Yes|Indicates the type of data source that incoming data will be read from. Allowed **datasource** type values are specific to the type of data source used.|  
  
 **Serialization**  
  
|Element name|Required|Notes|  
|------------------|--------------|-----------|  
|**type**|Yes|This element is associated with the **serialization** element. It indicates the type of serialization that the input uses. Supported values for stream data include: CSV, JSON, and Avro. Supported values for reference data include: CSV.<br><br> Note that CSV formatted data requires a header row where all header column names are unique. |  
|**fieldDelimiter**|For CSV|This element is associated with the **serialization** element and is required when the **serialization** type is CSV. <br />It specifies the delimiter that will be used to separate comma-separated value (CSV) records. Supported values include:<br /><br /> -   Space<br />-   Comma<br />-   Tab<br />-   ‘&#124;’<br />-   Semi-colon|
