# Aggregate

A (User-Defined) Aggregate provides an extensible way for a Streaming Job to transform aggregation data to output data using a facility that is not described by the Aggregation query.

## Create

Creates a new Stream Analytics user-defined aggregate.

### Request

The **Create Function** request is specified as follows.

For headers and parameters that are used by all requests related to Stream Analytics jobs, see  [Common parameters and headers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/8d088ecc-26eb-42e9-8acc-fe929ed33563). Make sure that the request that is made to the management service is secure. For more information, see  [Authenticating Azure Resource Manager requests](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790557.aspx).


| Method | Request URI |
| --- | --- |
| **PUT** | https://&lt;endpoint&gt;/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/streamingjobs/{jobName}/functions/{aggregateName}?api-version={api-version} |

**Parameters**

* Replace {subscription-id} with your subscription ID.

* Replace {resource-group-name} with the name of the resource group that this job belongs to. For more information about creating resource groups, see  [Using resource groups to manage your Azure resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/azure-preview-portal-using-resource-groups/).

* Replace {job-name} with the name that you want to assign to the Stream Analytics job that you are creating. The job name is case insensitive and must be unique among all inputs in the job, containing only numbers, letters, and hyphens. It must be 3 to 63 characters long.

* Replace {aggregateName} with the name of the user-defined aggregate.

* Replace {api-version} with 2015-10-01 in the URI.

**Request Headers**

Common request headers only.

**Request Body**

**JSON**

```json
{  
  "properties": {  
    "type": "<aggregate type>",  
    "properties": {  
      .  
      . "aggregate type-specific properties"  
      .  
    }  
  }  
}  

```

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | Yes | The aggregate type value is "Aggregate". |
| **properties** | Yes | Collection of aggregate type-specific properties. May be empty. |


Properties for Aggregate function type:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| inputs | An array of inputs, describing the parameters of the UDA accumulate function. |
| Inputs.dataType | Data type of the UDA parameter. List of valid Azure Stream Analytics data types are described at  [Azure Stream Analytics data types](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn835065.aspx). |
| Input.isConfigurationParameter | Optional. True if this parameter is expected to be a constant. Default is false. |
| output | Described output of the UDA computeResult function. |

    "type": "{aggregate type}",  
    "properties": {  
      .

      .  
    }  
  }  
}  


```

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **type** | Yes\* | The aggregate type string "Aggregate". |
| **properties** | Yes | Collection of function type-specific properties to change. May be empty. |

\*Using PATCH to change the function type is not permitted. Since changing the function type likely would specify a whole new set of function type-specific properties. PUT rather than PATCH should be used to replace the complete entity.

> [!NOTE]  
> Update Function validates if the binding and input columns specified matches, if it doesn't it would return an error. This validation is triggered only if either input or output is specified.

## Examples

Aggregate type, Binding type, and key properties describing the binding should always be provided.

**Response**

**Status code:**

* 200 (OK) if request completed successfully (or resource does not exist)
* 409 (Conflict) if job is in a state where updating functions is not allowed
* 412 (Precondition Failed) if failed condition specified by If-Match header.
* 400 (Bad Request) if request body fails validation.

**Response Headers**

Common response headers only

**Response Body**

```json
{  
  "properties": {  
    "type": "{aggregate type}",  
    "properties": {
