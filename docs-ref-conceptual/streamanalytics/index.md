# Stream Analytics REST API
  Use the operations described in this REST API to manage Azure Stream Analytics resources through Azure Resource Manager. All task operations in this REST API conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification, and each operation returns an **x-ms-request-id** header that can be used to obtain information about the request. You must make sure that requests made to these resources are secure. For more information, see [Authenticating Azure Resource Manager requests](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790557.aspx).  
  
 Note the current version of the Stream Analytics REST API is 2015-10-01.
