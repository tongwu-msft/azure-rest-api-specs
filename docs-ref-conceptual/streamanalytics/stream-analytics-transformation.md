|**DELETE**|https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.StreamAnalytics/streamingjobs/{job-name}/transformations/{transformation-name}?api-version={api-version}|  
  
 Replace {subscription-id} with your subscription ID.  
  
 Replace {resource-group-name} with the name of the resource group that this transformation belongs to.

### Response  
 Status code: 202  
  
 This is an asynchronous operation that returns a status of 202 until the job is successfully deleted. The **Location** response header contains the URI that is used to obtain the status of the process. While the process is running, a call to the URI in the **Location** header returns a status of 202.
