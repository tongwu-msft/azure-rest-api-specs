# Replace an Offer
  To replace an entire offer resource, perform a PUT operation on the specific user resource. There are two versions of offers currently supported – V1 for pre-defined throughput and V2 for user-defined throughput. To learn more about the maximum and minimum provisioned throughput that can be set on a container or a database, see the [Provision throughput on containers and databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/set-throughput) article.  
  
## Request  
  
|Method|Request URI|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
|PUT|`https://{databaseaccount}.documents.azure.com/offers/{_rid-offer}`|{databaseaccount} is the name of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created under your subscription. The {_rid-offer} value is the system generated resource ID of the offer.|  
  
### Headers  
 See [Common Azure Cosmos DB REST request headers](common-cosmosdb-rest-request-headers.md) for headers that are used by all Cosmos DB requests  
  
### Body  
  
|Property|Required|Description|  
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|  
|**offerVersion**|Required|It can be V1 for pre-defined throughput levels and V2 for user-defined throughput levels.|  
|**offerType**|Optional|This property is only applicable in V1 offer version. A user can explicitly set this property. You should set it to S1, S2, or S3 for pre-defined performance levels, and Invalid for user-defined performance levels.|  
|**content**|Required|Contains information about the offer – for V2 offers, this value contains the throughput of the collection.|  
|**resource**|Required|When creating a new collection, this property is set to the self-link of the collection for example, dbs/pLJdAA==/colls/pLJdAOlEdgA=/.|  
|**offerResourceId**|Required|During creation of a collection, this property is automatically associated to the resource ID, that is, **_rid** of the collection. In the example above, the **_rid** for the collection is pLJdAOlEdgA=.|  
|**id**|Required|It is a system generated property. The **ID** for the offer resource is automatically generated when it is created. It has the same value as the **_rid** for the offer.|  
|**_rid**|Required|It is a system generated property. The resource ID (**_rid**) is a unique identifier that is also hierarchical per the resource stack on the resource model. It is used internally for placement and navigation of the offer.|  
  
```  
{   
  "offerVersion": "V2",   
  "offerType": "Invalid",   
  "content": {   
    "offerThroughput": 4000   
  },   
  "resource": "dbs/rgkVAA==/colls/rgkVAMHcJww=/",   
  "offerResourceId": "rgkVAMHcJww=",   
  "id": "uT2L",   
  "_rid": "uT2L",   
}   
  
```  
  
## Response  
 Returns the updated offer resource.  
  
### Headers  
 See [Common Azure Cosmos DB REST response headers](common-cosmosdb-rest-response-headers.md) for headers that are returned by all Cosmos DB responses.  
  
### Status codes  
 The following table lists common status codes returned by this operation. For a full list of status codes, see [HTTP Status Codes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783364.aspx).  
  
|HTTP status code|Description|  
|----------------------|-----------------|  
|200 OK|The replace operation was successful.|  
|400 Bad Request|The JSON body is invalid. Check for missing curly brackets or quotes.|  
|401 Unauthorized|The Authorization or x-ms-date header is not set. 401 is also returned when the Authorization header is set to an invalid authorization token.|  
|404 Not Found|The offer is no longer a resource, that is, the resource was deleted.|  
| 429 Too Many Requests | The replace offer is throttled because the offer scale down operation is attempted within the idle timeout period, that is 4 hours. Refer to the “x-ms-retry-after-ms response” header to see how long you should wait before retrying this operation. |
  
### Body  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**offerVersion**| This value can be V1 for pre-defined throughput levels and V2 for user-defined throughput levels.|  
|**offerType**| Pre-defined performance levels S1, S2, or S3 for V1 Offers. Its set to Invalid for user-defined performance levels.|  
|**content**|  It contains information about the offer. For V2 offers, it contains the throughput of the collection.|  
|**resource**|When creating a new collection, this property is set to the self-link of the collection for example, dbs/pLJdAA==/colls/pLJdAOlEdgA=/.|  
|**offerResourceId**| During creation of a collection, this property is automatically associated to the resource ID, that is, **_rid** of the collection. In the example above, the **_rid** for the collection is  pLJdAOlEdgA=.|  
|**id**|It is a system generated property. The **ID** for the offer resource is automatically generated when it is created. It has the same value as the **_rid** for the offer.|  
|**_rid**|It is a system generated property. The resource ID (**_rid**) is a unique identifier that is also hierarchical per the resource stack on the resource model. It is used internally for placement and navigation of the offer.|  
|**_ts**|It is a system generated property. It specifies the last updated timestamp of the resource. The value is a timestamp.|  
|**_self**|It is a system generated property. It is the unique addressable URI for the resource.|  
|**_etag**|It is a system generated property that specifies the resource etag required for optimistic concurrency control.|

## Remarks 

 To learn more about the maximum and minimum provisioned throughput that can be set on a container or a database, see the [Provision throughput on containers and databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/set-throughput) article.    
 
Perform GET on the offer resource to retrieve the minimum throughput that could be set for a given container or a database. The response header `x-ms-cosmos-min-throughput` denotes the system determined minimum throughput.
