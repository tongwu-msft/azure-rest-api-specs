# Replace an Offer
  To replace an entire offer resource, perform a PUT operation on the specific offer resource. To learn more about the maximum and minimum provisioned throughput that can be set on a container or a database, see the [Provision throughput on containers and databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/set-throughput) article. 
  
## Request  
  
|Method|Request URI|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
|PUT|`https://{databaseaccount}.documents.azure.com/offers/{_rid-offer}`|{databaseaccount} is the name of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created under your subscription. The {_rid-offer} value is the system-generated resource ID of the offer.|  

> [!TIP]
> To find the _rid of the offer associated with a database or collection, first [GET the database](get-a-database.md) or [GET the collection](get-a-collection.md) and note the _rid property of the resource. Then, [query the offers](querying-offers.md) to find the _rid-offer that corresponds to the database or collection's _rid. Typically, a database _rid is length 8, a collection _rid is length 12, and an offer _rid is length 4.
  
### Headers  
 See [Common Azure Cosmos DB REST request headers](common-cosmosdb-rest-request-headers.md) for headers that are used by all Cosmos DB requests  
  
### Body  
  
|Property|Required|Description|  
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|  
|**offerVersion**|Required|It can be V1 for the [legacy S1, S2, and S3 levels](/azure/cosmos-db/performance-levels) and V2 for [user-defined throughput levels](/azure/cosmos-db/set-throughput) (recommended).
|**offerType**|Optional|This property is only applicable in the V1 offer version. Set it to S1, S2, or S3 for V1 offer types. It is invalid for user-defined performance levels or provisioned throughput based model.|  
|**content**|Required|Contains information about the offer â€“ for V2 offers, this value contains the throughput of the collection.|  
|**resource**|Required|When creating a new collection, this property is set to the self-link of the collection for example, dbs/pLJdAA==/colls/pLJdAOlEdgA=/.|  
|**offerResourceId**|Required|During creation of a collection, this property is automatically associated to the resource ID, that is, **_rid** of the collection. In the example above, the **_rid** for the collection is pLJdAOlEdgA=.|  
|**id**|Required|It is a system-generated property. The **ID** for the offer resource is automatically generated when it is created. It has the same value as the **_rid** for the offer.|  
|**_rid**|Required|It is a system-generated property. The resource ID (**_rid**) is a unique identifier that is also hierarchical per the resource stack on the resource model. It is used internally for placement and navigation of the offer.|  
  
```  
{   
  "offerVersion": "V2",   
  "offerType": "Invalid",   
  "content": {   
    "offerThroughput": 4000   
  },

  "offerResourceId": "rgkVAMHcJww=",   
  "id": "uT2L",   
  "_rid": "uT2L",   
}   
  
```  
  
## Response  
 Returns the updated offer resource.  
  
### Headers  
 See [Common Azure Cosmos DB REST response headers](common-cosmosdb-rest-response-headers.md) for headers that are returned by all Cosmos DB responses.  
  
### Status codes  
 The following table lists common status codes returned by this operation. For a full list of status codes, see [HTTP Status Codes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783364.aspx).  
  
|HTTP status code|Description|  
|----------------------|-----------------|  
|200 OK|The replace operation was successful.|  
|400 Bad Request|The JSON body is invalid. Check for missing curly brackets or quotes.|  
|401 Unauthorized|The Authorization or x-ms-date header is not set. 401 is also returned when the Authorization header is set to an invalid authorization token.|  
|404 Not Found|The offer is no longer a resource, that is, the resource was deleted.|  
| 429 Too Many Requests | The replace offer is throttled because the offer scale down operation is attempted within the idle timeout period, that is 4 hours. Refer to the "x-ms-retry-after-ms response" header to see how long you should wait before retrying this operation. |
  
### Body

## Example 2 
This example shows how to change the max throughput (RU/s) of an offer with autoscale throughput to 8000 RU/s (scales between 800 - 8000 RU/s)

```

## Example 3 
This example shows how to migrate an offer with manual throughput to autoscale throughput. The header ``x-ms-cosmos-migrate-offer-to-autopilot`` with value ``true`` is required.

When migrating, Azure Cosmos DB automatically determines the new autoscale max RU/s based on the current resource settings. The `maxThroughput` property in the response object represents the default autoscale max RU/s set by the system.

In the body, the ``content`` property with a defined ``offerThroughput`` is required, but the value will be ignored by the service. The following example uses -1.

After the change is complete, you can follow [Example 2](#example-2) to change the autoscale max RU/s to a custom value.

```
Below is a sample response body. 

The property `maxThroughput` represents the autoscale max RU/s set by the system. The property `offerThroughput` represents the RU/s the system is currently scaled to.

```

## Example 4
This example shows how to migrate an offer with autoscale throughput to manual throughput. The header ``x-ms-cosmos-migrate-offer-to-manual-throughput`` with value ``true`` is required.

When migrating, Azure Cosmos DB automatically determines the new manual throughput (RU/s) based on the current resource settings. After the change is complete, you can follow [Example 1](#example-1) to change the manual RU/s to a custom value.


In the body, the ``content`` property with a defined ``offerAutopilotSettings`` and ``maxThroughput`` is required, but the value will be ignored by the service. Below we pass in -1.

    "_ts": 1595461384
}
```

## Remarks

When you are changing the manual or autoscale throughput on a database or container, the system enforces constraints on the RU/s that can be set on the resource. To learn more about the minimum and maximum provisioned throughput (RU/s) that can be set with manual throughput, see the [Provision throughput on containers and databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/set-throughput) article. To learn about the minimum autoscale max RU/s you can set, see the [autoscale FAQ](/azure/cosmos-db/autoscale-faq.md#can-i-change-the-max-rus-on-the-database-or-container).
 
To retrieve the minimum throughput that can be set on database or container, perform GET on the offer resource. The response header `x-ms-cosmos-min-throughput` denotes the system determined minimum throughput. This represents the minimum value you can set for the RU/s on a resource with manual throughput, or the minimum value you can set for the autoscale max RU/s on a resource with autoscale throughput.
