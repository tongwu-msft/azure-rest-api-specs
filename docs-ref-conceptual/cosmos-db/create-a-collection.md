# Create Collection
The `Create Collection` operation creates a new collection in a database.   
  
## Request  
  
|Method|Request URI|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
|POST|https://{databaseaccount}.documents.azure.com/dbs/{db-id}/colls|The {databaseaccount} is the name of the Azure Cosmos DB account created under your subscription. {db-id} can be either the ID or the _rid value for the database.|  
  
### Headers  
 See [Common Azure Cosmos DB REST request headers](common-cosmosdb-rest-request-headers.md) for headers that are used by all Azure Cosmos DB requests.  
  
|Property|Required|Type|Description|  
|--------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|**x-ms-offer-throughput**|Optional|Number|The user specified throughput for the collection expressed in units of 100 request units per second. It can be between 400 and 250,000 (or higher by requesting a limit increase).<br /><br /> If the **x-ms-offer-throughput** is over 10,000, then the collection must include a **partitionKey** definition. If the **x-ms-offer-throughput** is equal to or under 10,000, then the **partitionKey** definition is optional.<br /><br /> One of **x-ms-offer-throughput** or **x-ms-offer-type** must be specified. Both headers cannot be specified together.|  
|**x-ms-offer-type**|Optional|String|The user specified performance level for pre-defined performance levels S1, S2, and S3. One of x-ms-offer-throughput or x-ms-offer-type must be specified. Both headers cannot be specified together.|  
  
### Body  
  
|Property|Required|Type|Description|  
|--------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|**id**|Required|String|The user generated unique name for the collection. No two collections can have the same IDs. It is a string that must not be more than 255 characters.|  
|**indexingPolicy**|Optional|Object|This value is used to configure indexing policy. By default, the indexing is automatic for all document paths within the collection.|  
|**partitionKey**|Optional|Object|This value is used to configure the partition key to be used for partitioning data into multiple partitions.<br /><br /> If the **x-ms-offer-throughput** is over 10,000, then the collection must include a **partitionKey** definition. If the **x-ms-offer-throughput** is equal to or under 10,000, then the collection must not include a **partitionKey** definition.|  
  
```  
{  
  "id": "testcoll",  
  "indexingPolicy": {  
    "automatic": true,  
    "indexingMode": "Consistent",  
    "includedPaths": [  
      {  
        "path": "/*",  
        "indexes": [  
          {  
            "dataType": "String",  
            "precision": -1,  
            "kind": "Range"  
          }  
        ]  
      }  
    ]  
  },  
  "partitionKey": {  
    "paths": [  
      "/AccountNumber"  
    ],  
    "kind": "Hash"  
  }  
}  
  
```  
  
## Response  
 Create Collection returns the created collection as a response body.  
  
### Headers  
 See [Common Azure Cosmos DB REST response headers](common-cosmosdb-rest-response-headers.md) for headers that are returned by all Azure Cosmos DB responses.  
  
### Status codes  
 The following table lists common status codes returned by this operation. For a full list of status codes, see [HTTP Status Codes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783364.aspx).  
  
|HTTP status code|Description|  
|----------------------|-----------------|  
|201 Created|The operation was successful.|  
|400 Bad Request|The JSON body is invalid. Check for missing curly brackets or quotes.|  
|409 Conflict|The ID provided for the new collection has been taken by an existing collection.|  
  
### Body  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**id**|It is the unique name that identifies the new collection.|  
|**_rid**|It is a system generated property. The resource ID (_rid) is a unique identifier that is also hierarchical per the resource stack on the resource model. It is used internally for placement and navigation of the permission resource.|  
|**_ts**|It is a system generated property. It specifies the last updated timestamp of the resource. The value is a timestamp.|  
|**_self**|It is a system generated property. It is the unique addressable URI for the resource.|  
|**_etag**|It is a system generated property representing the resource **etag** required for optimistic concurrency control.|  
|**_doc**|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the documents resource.|  
|**_sprocs**|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the stored procedures (sprocs) resource.|  
|**_triggers**|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the triggers resource.|  
|**_udfs**|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the user-defined functions (udfs) resource.|  
|**_conflicts**|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the conflicts resource. During an operation on a resource within a collection, if a conflict occurs, users can inspect the conflicting resources by performing a GET on the conflicts URI path.|  
|**indexingPolicy**|It is the indexing policy settings for collection.|  
|**partitionKey**|It is the partitioning configuration settings for collection.|  
  
 **Properties under Included Paths**  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**path**|Path for which the indexing behavior applies to. Index paths start with the root (/) and typically end with the question mark (?) wildcard operator, denoting that there are multiple possible values for the prefix. For example, to serve SELECT * FROM Families F WHERE F.familyName = "Andersen", you must include an index path for /familyName/? in the collection’s index policy.<br /><br /> Index paths can also use the \* wildcard operator to specify the behavior for paths recursively under the prefix. For example, /payload/\* can be used to exclude everything under the payload property from indexing.|  
|**dataType**|It is the datatype for which the indexing behavior is applied to. Can be **String**, **Number**, **Point**, **Polygon**, or **LineString**. Booleans and nulls are automatically indexed|  
|**kind**|The type of index. **Hash** indexes are useful for equality comparisons while **Range** indexes are useful for equality, range comparisons and sorting. **Spatial** indexes are useful for spatial queries.|  
|**precision**|The precision of the index. Can be either set to -1 for maximum precision or between 1-8 for **Number**, and 1-100 for **String**. Not applicable for **Point**, **Polygon**, and **LineString** data types.|  
  
 **Properties under Excluded Paths**  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**path**|Path that is excluded from indexing. Index paths start with the root (/) and typically end with the * wildcard operator. For example, /payload/\* can be used to exclude everything under the payload property from indexing.|  
  
 **Properties under Partition Key**  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|**paths**|An array of paths using which data within the collection can be partitioned. Paths must not contain a wildcard or a trailing slash. For example, the JSON property “AccountNumber” is specified as “/AccountNumber”. The array must contain only a single value.|  
|**kind**|The algorithm used for partitioning. Only Hash is supported.|
