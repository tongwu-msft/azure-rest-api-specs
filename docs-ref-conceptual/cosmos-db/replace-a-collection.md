# Replace a Collection
  Replace Collection supports changing the indexing policy of a collection after creation. Changing other properties of a collection like the ID or the partition key are not supported.  
  
## Request  
  
|Method|Request URI|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
|PUT|https://{databaseaccount}.documents.azure.com/dbs/{db-id}/colls/{coll-id}| The {databaseaccount} is the name of the Azure Cosmos DB account created under your subscription. The {db-id} value is the user generated name/id of the database, not the system generated id (rid). The {coll-id} value is the name of the collection to be replaced.|  
  
### Headers  
 See [Common Azure Cosmos DB REST request headers](common-cosmosdb-rest-request-headers.md) for headers that are used by all Cosmos DB requests.  
  
### Body  
  
|Property|Required|Type|Description|  
|--------------|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|**id**|Required|String|The user generated unique name for the collection. No two collections can have the same ids. It is a string that must not be more than 255 characters.|  
|**indexingPolicy**|Optional|Object|It is a system generated property. The resource ID (**_rid**) is a unique identifier that is also hierarchical per the resource stack on the resource model. It is used internally for placement and navigation of the permission resource.|  

> [!NOTE]
> When you set custom index paths, you are required to specify the default indexing rule for the entire document tree, which is denoted by the special path "/*". 
>

## Response  
 Replace Collection returns the updated collection as a response body.  
  
### Headers  
 See [Common Azure Cosmos DB REST response headers](common-cosmosdb-rest-response-headers.md) for headers that are returned by all Cosmos DB responses.  
  
### Status codes  
 The following table lists common status codes returned by this operation. For a full list of status codes, see [HTTP Status Codes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783364.aspx).  
  
|Code|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|201 Created|The operation was successful.|  
|400 Bad Request|The JSON body is invalid. Check for missing curly brackets or quotes.|  
|409 Conflict|The id provided for the new collection has been taken by an existing collection.|  
  
### Body  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|id|It is the unique name that identifies the new collection.|  
|_rid|It is a system generated property. The resource ID (_rid) is a unique identifier that is also hierarchical per the resource stack on the resource model. It is used internally for placement and navigation of the permission resource.|  
|_ts|It is a system generated property. It specifies the last updated timestamp of the resource. The value is a timestamp.|  
|_self|It is a system generated property. It is the unique addressable URI for the resource.|  
|_etag|It is a system generated property representing the resource etag required for optimistic concurrency control.|  
|_doc|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the documents resource.|  
|_sprocs|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the stored procedures (sprocs) resource.|  
|_triggers|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the triggers resource.|  
|_udfs|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the user-defined functions (udfs) resource.|  
|_conflicts|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the conflicts resource. During an operation on a resource within a collection, if a conflict occurs, users can inspect the conflicting resources by performing a GET on the conflicts URI path.|  
|indexingPolicy|It is the indexing policy settings for collection.|  
|partitionKey|It is the partitioning configuration settings for collection.|  
  
 **Properties under Included Paths**  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|path|Path for which the indexing behavior applies to. Index paths start with the root (/) and typically end with the ? wildcard operator, denoting that there are multiple possible values for the prefix. For example, to serve SELECT * FROM Families F WHERE F.familyName = "Andersen", you must include an index path for /familyName/? in the collectionâ€™s index policy.<br /><br /> Index paths can also use the \* wildcard operator to specify the behavior for paths recursively under the prefix. For example, /payload/\* can be used to exclude everything under the payload property from indexing.|  
|dataType|It is the datatype for which the indexing behavior is applied to. Can be **String**, **Number**, *Point**, **Polygon**, or **LineString**. Booleans and nulls are automatically indexed|  
|kind|The type of index. **Hash** indexes are useful for equality comparisons while **Range** indexes are useful for equality, range comparisons and sorting. **Spatial** indexes are useful for spatial queries.|  
|precision|The precision of the index. Can be either set to -1 for maximum precision or between 1-8 for **Number**, and 1-100 for **String**. Not applicable for **Point**, **Polygon**, and **LineString** data types.| 
  
 **Properties under Excluded Paths**  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|path|Path that is excluded from indexing. Index paths start with the root (/) and typically end with the * wildcard operator. For example, /payload/\* can be used to exclude everything under the payload property from indexing.|
