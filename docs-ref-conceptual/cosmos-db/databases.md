# Databases
[Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) is a globally distributed multi-model database that supports the document, graph, and key-value data models. The content in this section is for creating, querying, and managing database [resources](/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-resources) using the [SQL API](/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-introduction) via REST.  

> [!NOTE]
> These API reference articles shows how to create resources using the Azure Cosmos DB data plane API. With the data plane API you can configure basic options such as indexing policy, partition keys much like you can with Cosmos DB SDKs. If you require complete feature support for all Azure Cosmos DB resources, we recommend using the [Cosmos DB Resource Provider](../cosmos-db-resource-provider/index.md). API reference articles are listed below.
 
Each Azure Cosmos DB account supports multiple independently named databases. A database is a logical namespace for collections, users, and permissions. The database resource is represented by **dbs** in the [Azure Cosmos DB resource model](/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-resources/). Hereâ€™s an example of the URI: `https://mydbaccount.documents.azure.com/dbs`.
  
Here is a sample representation of a database in Azure Cosmos DB:  
  
```json
{  
  "id":"ContosoDB",  
  "_rid":"rnYYAA==",  
  "_ts":1408056022,  
  "_self":"dbs\/rnYYAA==\/",  
  "_etag":"00004800-0000-0000-0000-53ed3ad60000",  
  "_colls":"colls\/",  
  "_users":"users\/"
}  
  
```  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|id|Required. It is the only [user settable property](/azure/cosmos-db/stored-procedures-triggers-udfs). It is a unique name that identifies the database, that is, no two databases share the same name in an account. The name must not exceed 255 characters.|  
|_rid|It is a [system generated property](/azure/cosmos-db/stored-procedures-triggers-udfs). The resource ID (**_rid**) is a system-generated identifier.|  
|_ts|It is a system generated property. It specifies the last updated timestamp of the resource. The value is a timestamp.|  
|_self|It is a system generated property. It is the unique addressable URI for the resource.|  
|_etag|It is a system generated property that specifies the resource etag required for optimistic concurrency control.|  
|_colls|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the **collections** resource.|  
|_users|It is a system generated property that specifies the addressable path of the **users** resource.|  
  
## Tasks  
 You can do the following tasks with databases:  
  
* [Create a Database](create-a-database.md)  
* [List Databases](list-databases.md)  
* [Get a Database](get-a-database.md)  
* [Delete a Database](delete-a-database.md)
* Query Databases
