# Custom Autosuggest API v7 reference

The Custom Autosuggest API lets you send a partial search query term to Bing and get back a list of suggested queries that you can configure. With Custom Autosuggest you add suggestions returned by the API and optionally specify whether to include suggestions generated by Bing.

Typically, you use this API to support a richer search experience.For example, as the user enters each character of their search term, you'd call this API and populate the search box's drop-down list with the suggested query strings.  
  
This section provides technical details about the query parameters and headers that the request may include, and the JSON response that contains the suggested queries.

For information about configuring custom suggestions, see [Configure your Custom Autosuggest experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-custom-search/define-custom-suggestions).
  
For information about the headers that you should include in the request, see [Request Headers](#headers).  
  
For information about the query parameters that you should include in the request, see [Query Parameters](#query-parameters).  
  
For information about the JSON objects that the response may include, see [Response Objects](#response-objects). 

For information about permitted use and display of results, see [Bing Search API Use and Display requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-autosuggest/useanddisplayrequirements).
 
  
## Endpoint  

To request custom query suggestions, send a GET request to:

```
https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bingcustomsearch/v7.0/Suggestions
```  
  
The request must use the HTTPS protocol.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The maximum URL length is 2,048 characters. To ensure that your URL length does not exceed the limit, the maximum length of your query parameters should be less than 1,500 characters. If the URL exceeds 2,048 characters, the server returns 404 Not found.  
  
## Headers  
The following are the headers that a request and response may include.  
  
|Header|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|
|<a name="subscriptionkey" />Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key|Required request header.<br /><br /> The subscription key that you received when you signed up for this service in [Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/).|    
|<a name="retryafter" />Retry-After|Response header.<br /><br /> The response includes this header if you exceed the number of queries allowed per second (QPS) or per month (QPM). The header contains the number of seconds that you must wait before sending another request.|  

> [!NOTE] 
> Remember that the Terms of Use require compliance with all applicable laws, including regarding use of these headers. For example, in certain jurisdictions, such as Europe, there are requirements to obtain user consent before placing certain tracking devices on user devices.
  
## Query parameters  

The following are the query parameters that the request may include. The Required column indicates whether you must specify the parameter. You must URL encode the query parameter values.  
  
|Name|Value|Type|Required|  
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|  
|<a name="customconfig" />customConfig|Unique identifier that identifies your custom search instance.<br /><br />|String|Yes
|<a name="query" />q|The user's search query string.<br /><br /> The query string must not be empty. If empty or not specified, the list of suggestions in the response is empty.<br /><br /> The API does not support the [Bing Advanced Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). If the query string includes Bing operators, the operators are treated as part of the query string, not as an operator.|String|No|  
  
## Response objects  

The following are the JSON objects that the response may include. If the request is successful, the top-level object in the response is the [Suggestions](#suggestions) object. If the request fails, the top-level object is [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse).

## Error codes 

The following are the possible HTTP status codes that a request returns.

|500|Unexpected server error.|

If the request fails, the response contains an [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse) object, which contains a list of [Error](#error) objects that describe what caused of error. If the error is related to a parameter, the `parameter` field identifies the parameter that is the issue. And if the error is related to a parameter value, the `value` field identifies the value that is not valid.

```json
{
  "_type": "ErrorResponse", 
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "InvalidRequest", 
      "subCode": "ParameterMissing", 
      "message": "Required parameter is missing.", 
      "parameter": "q" 
    }
  ]
}

{
  "_type": "ErrorResponse", 
  "errors": [
