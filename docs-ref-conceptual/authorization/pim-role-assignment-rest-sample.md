# Use Azure PIM to manage active access with the REST API

[Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/) enables you to limit standing administrator access to privileged roles, discover who has access, and review privileged access. This article describes the common ways to manage access using the REST API.

## List active assignments

To list active role assignments (list access), you can use one of the [Role Assignment Schedule Instances - List For Scope](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-schedule-instances/list-for-scope) or [Role Assignment Schedules - List For Scope](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-schedules/list-for-scope) REST APIs. To refine your results, you specify a scope and an optional filter. To call the API, you must have access to the `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/read` operation at the specified scope. All [built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) are granted access to this operation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The difference between *schedules* and *schedule instances* is that while schedule instances only include assignments that are active at the current time, schedules also include assignments that will become active in the future.

1. Start with the following request:

    ```http
    GET https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignmentScheduleInstances?api-version=2020-10-01-preview&$filter={filter}
    ```    
    ```http
    GET https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignmentSchedules?api-version=2020-10-01-preview&$filter={filter}
    ```    

1. Within the URI, replace *{scope}* with the scope for which you want to list the role assignments.

    | Scope | Type |
    | --- | --- |
    | `providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{mg-name}` | Management Group |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` | Subscription |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1` | Resource group |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/mysite1` | Resource |

1. Replace *{filter}* with the condition that you want to apply to filter the role assignment list.

    | Filter | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `$filter=atScope()` | List role assignments for only the specified scope, not including the role assignments at subscopes. |
    | `$filter=principalId%20eq%20'{objectId}'` | List role assignments for a specified user, group, or service principal. |
    | `$filter=roleDefinitionId%20eq%20'{roleDefinitionId}'` | List role assignments for a specified role definition. |
    | `$filter=assignedTo('{objectId}')` | List role assignments for a specified user, including ones inherited from groups. |
    | `$filter=asTarget()` | List role assignments for the current user or service principal, including ones inherited from groups. |
    | `$filter=assignedTo('{objectId}')+and+atScope()` | List role assignments for a specified user, including ones inherited from groups for only the specified scope, not including the role assignments at subscopes.|
    
## Grant active assignment

To create an active role assignment (grant access), you use the [Role Assignment Schedule Requests - Create](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-schedule-requests/create) REST API and specify the security principal, role definition, schedule, requestType = `AdminAssign` and scope. To call this API, you must have access to `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` operation. Of the built-in roles, only [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) and [User Access Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) are granted access to this operation.

1. Use the [Role Definitions - List](/rest/api/authorization/roledefinitions/list) REST API or see [Built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) to get the identifier for the role definition you want to assign.

1. Use a GUID tool to generate a unique identifier that will be used for the role assignment identifier. The identifier has the format: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

1. Start with the following request and body:

    ```http
    PUT https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignmentScheduleRequests/{roleAssignmentScheduleRequestName}?api-version=2020-10-01-preview
    ```

    ```json
    {
      "Properties": {
        "RoleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{roleDefinitionId}",
        "PrincipalId": "{principalId}",
        "RequestType": "AdminAssign",
        "ScheduleInfo": {
          "StartDateTime": "2020-09-09T21:31:27.91Z",
          "Expiration": {
            "Type": "AfterDuration", // Values: AfterDuration, AfterDateTime, NoExpiration
            "EndDateTime": null,
            "Duration": "P30D" // Use ISO 8601 format
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
1. Within the URI, replace *{scope}* with the scope for the role assignment.

    | Scope | Type |
    | --- | --- |
    | `providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{mg-name}` | Management Group |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` | Subscription |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1` | Resource group |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/mysite1` | Resource |

1. Replace *{roleAssignmentScheduleRequestName}* with the GUID identifier of the role assignment.

1. Within the request body, replace *{subscriptionId}* with your subscription identifier.

1. Replace *{roleDefinitionId}* with the role definition identifier.

1. Replace *{principalId}* with the object identifier of the user, group, or service principal that will be assigned the role.

## Remove active assignment

To remove an active role assignment (remove access), use the [Role Assignment Schedule Requests - Create](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-schedule-requests/create) REST API to create a new request to revoke assignment and specify the security principal, role definition, requestType = `AdminRemove` and scope. To call this API, you must have access to the `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` operation. Of the built-in roles, only [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) and [User Access Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) are granted access to this operation.

1. Use a GUID tool to generate a unique identifier that will be used for the role assignment identifier. The identifier has the format: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

1. Start with the following request:

    ```http
    PUT https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignmentScheduleRequests/{roleAssignmentScheduleRequestName}?api-version=2020-10-01-preview
    ```
    
    ```json
    {
      "Properties": {
        "RoleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{roleDefinitionId}",
        "PrincipalId": "{principalId}",
        "RequestType": "AdminRemove"
        }
    }
    ```
    
1. Within the URI, replace *{scope}* with the scope for removing the role assignment.

    | Scope | Type |
    | --- | --- |
    | `providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{mg-name}` | Management Group |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` | Subscription |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1` | Resource group |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1/ providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/mysite1` | Resource |

1. Replace *{roleAssignmentScheduleRequestName}* with the GUID identifier of the role assignment.

## Activate an eligible role assignment

To activate an eligible role assignment (gain activated access), use the [Role Assignment Schedule Requests - Create](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-schedule-requests/create) REST API to create a new request and specify the security principal, role definition, requestType = `SelfActivate` and scope. To call this API, you must have an eligible role assignment on the scope.

1. Use a GUID tool to generate a unique identifier that will be used for the role assignment identifier. The identifier has the format: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

1. [Optional] Choose a `RoleEligibilitySchedule` that you want to activate and get the `RoleEligibilityScheduleId` from the [Role Eligibility Schedules](rest/api/authorization/role-eligibility-schedules) API to pass in as the `LinkedRoleEligibilityScheduleId`. This is optional, and if not passed the system will pick a `RoleEligibilitySchedule`.

1. Start with the following request:

    ```http
    PUT https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignmentScheduleRequests/{roleAssignmentScheduleRequestName}?api-version=2020-10-01-preview
    ```
    
   ```json
    {
      "Properties": {
        "RoleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{roleDefinitionId}",
        "PrincipalId": "{principalId}",
        "RequestType": "SelfActivate",
        "ScheduleInfo": {
          "StartDateTime": "2020-09-09T21:31:27.91Z",
          "Expiration": {
            "Type": "AfterDuration", // Values: AfterDuration, AfterDateTime, NoExpiration
            "EndDateTime": null,
            "Duration": "PT8H" // Use ISO 8601 format
          }
        },
        "LinkedRoleEligibilityScheduleId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignmentSchedules/{roleAssignmentScheduleId}" //Optional
      }
    }
    ```
    
1. Within the URI, replace *{scope}* with the scope for removing the role assignment.

    | Scope | Type |
    | --- | --- |
    | `providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{mg-name}` | Management Group |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` | Subscription |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1` | Resource group |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1/ providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/mysite1` | Resource |

1. Replace *{roleAssignmentScheduleRequestName}* with the GUID identifier of the role assignment.

## Deactivate an active role assignment

To de-activate an activated role assignment (remove activated access), use the [Role Assignment Schedule Requests - Create](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-schedule-requests/create) REST API to create a new request and specify the security principal, role definition, requestType = `SelfDeactivate` and scope. To call this API, you must have an activated role assignment on the scope.

1. Use a GUID tool to generate a unique identifier that will be used for the role assignment identifier. The identifier has the format: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

1. Start with the following request:

    ```http
    PUT https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignmentScheduleRequests/{roleAssignmentScheduleRequestName}?api-version=2020-10-01-preview
    ```
    
   ```json
    {
      "Properties": {
        "RoleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{roleDefinitionId}",
        "PrincipalId": "{principalId}",
        "RequestType": "SelfDeactivate"        
      }
    }
    ```
    
1. Within the URI, replace *{scope}* with the scope for removing the role assignment.

    | Scope | Type |
    | --- | --- |
    | `providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{mg-name}` | Management Group |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` | Subscription |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1` | Resource group |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1/ providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/mysite1` | Resource |

1. Replace *{roleAssignmentScheduleRequestName}* with the GUID identifier of the role assignment.

## Just-Enough-Access (JEA)

If a user has an eligible role assignment at a resource (parent), they can choose to activate the role at a child level scope of the parent resource instead of the entire parent scope. For example, if a user has `Contributor` eligible role at a subscription, they can activate the role at a child resource group level of the subscription.

To get a list of all children of a resource on which you have eligble access you can use the [Eligible Child Resources](rest/api/authorization/eligible-child-resources) API.

1. Start with the following request:

    ```http
    GET https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/eligibleChildResources?api-version=2020-10-01-preview&$filter={filter}
    ```    

1. Within the URI, replace *{scope}* with the scope for which you want to list the role assignments.

    | Scope | Type |
    | --- | --- |
    | `providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/{mg-name}` | Management Group |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` | Subscription |
    | `subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1` | Resource group |

1. Replace *{filter}* with the condition that you want to apply to filter the role assignment list.

    | Filter | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `$filter=resourceType+eq+'Subscription' ` | List resources of type = 'Subscription'. |
    | `$filter=$filter=resourceType+eq+'subscription'+or+resourceType+eq+'resourcegroup'' ` | List resources of type = 'Subscription' or type = 'ResourceGroup'. |
    
1. Use the `id` of any child resource to use as the `scope` for the activation `RoleAssignmentScheduleRequest`
