# Use Role Assignment Approvals to approve PIM role activation requests with REST API

## List all role assignment approval requests

To list role assignment approval requests, you can use the [Role Assignment Approval - List](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-approval/list) REST API. To refine your results, you can specify an optional filter.

1. Start with the following request:

    ```http
    GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignmentApprovals?api-version=2020-10-01-preview&$filter={filter}
    ```    

1. Replace *{filter}* with the condition that you want to apply to filter the role assignment list.

    | Filter | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `$filter=asApprover()` | List only includes all role assignment approvals that the calling user is assigned as an approver for. |
    | `$filter=asCreatedBy()` | List only includes all role assignment approvals that the calling user created requests for. |
    | `$filter=asTarget()` | List only includes all role assignment approvals that the calling user has requests targeted for. |

1. You need to extract the `id` of each `stage` of the `roleAssignmentApproval` and approve or deny the stage.

## Get approval stage details

To get the details of any stage of a role assignment approval, you can use [Role Assignment Approval Step - Get By ID](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-approval-step/get-by-id) REST API.

1. Use the following request:

    ```http
    GET https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignmentApprovals/{approvalId}/stages/{stageId}?api-version=2021-01-01-preview
    ```    

## Approve or Deny an approval stage

To approve or deny of any stage of a role assignment approval, you can use [Role Assignment Approval Step - Patch](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-approval-step/patch) REST API.

1. Use the following request:

    ```http
    PATCH https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignmentApprovals/{approvalId}/stages/{stageId}?api-version=2021-01-01-preview
    ```  
    ````json
    {    
        "properties": {
            "reviewResult": "Approve", // Or "Deny"
            "justification": "Trusted User"
        }
    }
    ````
