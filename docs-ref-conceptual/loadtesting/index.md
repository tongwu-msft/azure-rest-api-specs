# Azure Load Testing REST API

Azure Load Testing Preview is a fully managed load-testing service that enables you to generate high-scale load. The service simulates traffic for your applications, regardless of where they're hosted. Developers, testers, and quality assurance (QA) engineers can use it to optimize application performance, scalability, or capacity. To learn more about Azure Load testing, see the [Azure Load Testing documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/load-testing/overview-what-is-azure-load-testing).
