# Azure Data Factory version 1 (V1)
Data Factory version 1 (V1) service allows you to create data pipelines that move and transform data, and then run the pipelines on a specified schedule (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.). It also provides rich visualizations to display the lineage and dependencies between your data pipelines, and monitor all your data pipelines from a single unified view to easily pinpoint issues and setup monitoring alerts.

This section provides information about REST APIs that are supported by version 1 of Azure Data Factory.
