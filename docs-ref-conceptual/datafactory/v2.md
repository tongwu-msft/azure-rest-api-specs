# Azure Data Factory version 2 (V2)
Azure Data Factory version 2 (V2) allows you to create and schedule data-driven workflows (called pipelines) that can ingest data from disparate data stores, process/transform the data by using compute services such as Azure HDInsight Hadoop, Spark, Azure Data Lake Analytics, and Azure Machine Learning, and publish output data to data stores such as Azure SQL Data Warehouse for business intelligence (BI) applications to consume. Ultimately, through Azure Data Factory, raw data can be organized into meaningful data stores and data lakes for better business decisions.

The topics under **Reference** node provides information about the REST API operations that are supported by version 2 of Azure Data Factory.
