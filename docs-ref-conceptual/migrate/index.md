The service assesses the migration suitability of on-premises machines, performance-based sizing, and provides cost estimations for running your on-premises machines in Azure. To learn more about Azure Migrate, see the [Azure Migrate documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-overview).
