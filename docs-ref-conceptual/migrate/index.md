# Azure Migrate REST API

Azure Migrate helps you to migrate to Azure. Azure Migrate provides a centralized hub to track discovery, assessment, and migration of on-premises infrastructure, applications, and data to Azure. The hub provides Azure tools for assessment and migration, as well as third-party independent software vendor (ISV) offerings. To learn more about Azure Migrate, see the [Azure Migrate documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/migrate-overview).
