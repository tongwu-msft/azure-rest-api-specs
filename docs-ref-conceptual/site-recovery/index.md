# Site Recovery  REST API

Azure Site Recovery contributes to your business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy by keeping apps and workloads available during outages. Site Recovery replicates on-premises and Azure workloads to a secondary location. When an outage occurs, you fail over to the secondary location. You recover apps to the primary site when itâ€™s up and running again.
