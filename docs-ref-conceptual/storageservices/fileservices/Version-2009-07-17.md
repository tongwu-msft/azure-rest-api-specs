# Version 2009-07-17
The 2009-07-17 version of the Azure storage services includes these changes:  
  
-   A root or default container that permits blobs to reside at the top level of the storage account hierarchy. See [Working with the Root Container](../fileservices/Working-with-the-Root-Container.md) for more information.  
  
-   Enhancements to the [Put Block List](../fileservices/Put-Block-List.md) operation for updating blobs.  
  
-   Delegated access to containers and blobs, via shared access signatures and container-level access policies. See [Manage Access to Azure Storage Resources](/azure/storage/storage-manage-access-to-resources) for more information.  
  
-   Thirty-second server timeouts for the [List Containers](../fileservices/List-Containers2.md), [List Blobs](../fileservices/List-Blobs.md), [List Queues](../fileservices/List-Queues1.md), [Query Tables](../fileservices/Query-Tables.md), and [Query Entities](../fileservices/Query-Entities.md) operations.  
  
-   A request against the Blob service may specify only a single conditional header. If a request specifies both the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers, the request is evaluated based on the criteria specified in `If-None-Match`. If a request specifies both the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers, the request is evaluated based on the criteria specified in `If-Match`. See [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](../fileservices/Specifying-Conditional-Headers-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md) for more information.
