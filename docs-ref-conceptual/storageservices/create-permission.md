# Create Permission

The `Create Permission` operation creates a permission (a security descriptor) at the share level. You can use the created security descriptor for the files and directories in the share. This API is available as of version 2019-02-02.

## Protocol availability

| Enabled file share protocol | Available |
|-|:-:|
| SMB | ![Yes](./media/yes-icon.png) |
| NFS | ![No](./media/no-icon.png) |
  
## Request

You can construct the `Create Permission` request as shown here. We recommend that you use HTTPS.  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP&nbsp;version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`PUT`|`https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myshare?restype=share&comp=filepermission`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
Replace the path components shown in the request URI with your own components, as shown here:  
  
|Path&nbsp;component|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`myaccount`|The name of your storage account.|  
|`myshare`|The name of your file share. The name can contain only lowercase characters.|  
  
For information about path-naming restrictions, see [Name and reference shares, directories, files, and metadata](Naming-and-Referencing-Shares--Directories--Files--and-Metadata.md).  
  
### URI parameters
  
You can specify additional parameters on the request URI as shown here:  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Set timeouts for Azure Queue operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Queue-Service-Operations.md).|  

### Request headers

The required and optional request headers are described in the following table:  
  
|Request&nbsp;header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
| `Authorization` | Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, storage account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Optional. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for Azure Storage services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1-kibibyte (KiB) character limit, which is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. We recommend that you use this header when you're correlating client-side activities with requests that are received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage analytics logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure logging: Use logs to track storage requests](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|    
  
### Request body

You create a security descriptor by using a request body, which is a JSON document that describes permission in the [Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL)](/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-definition-language). SDDL must have an owner, group, and [discretionary access control list (DACL)](/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists). The provided SDDL string format of the security descriptor shouldn't have a domain relative identifier (for example, DU, DA, or DD) in it.

```json
{
    "Permission": "SDDL"
}
```
  
### Sample request  
  
```
PUT https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myshare?restype=share&comp=filepermission HTTP/1.1  

Request Headers:  
x-ms-date: Mon, 27 Jan 2014 22:15:50 GMT  
x-ms-version: 2014-02-14  
Authorization: SharedKey myaccount:4KdWDiTdA9HmIF9+WF/8WfYOpUrFhieGIT7f0av+GEI=  

Request Body:
{"permission": "O:S-1-5-21-2127521184-1604012920-1887927527-21560751G:S-1-5-21-2127521184-1604012920-1887927527-513D:AI(A;;FA;;;SY)(A;;FA;;;BA)(A;;0x1200a9;;;S-1-5-21-397955417-626881126-188441444-3053964)"}
```  
  
## Response

The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.  
  
### Status code

A successful operation returns status code 201 (Created).
  
For information about status codes, see [Status and error codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).
  
### Response headers

The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response might also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Response&nbsp;header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
| `x-ms-request-id` | Uniquely identifies the request that was made, and you can use it to troubleshoot the request. |
| `x-ms-version` | Indicates the Azure Files version that was used to execute the request. |
| `Date` or `x-ms-date` | A UTC date/time value that's generated by the service and that indicates the time when the response was initiated. |
| `x-ms-file-permission-key` | The key of the permission created. |
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Can be used to troubleshoot requests and their corresponding responses. The value of this header is equal to the value of the `x-ms-client-request-id` header if it's present in the request and the value contains no more than 1024 visible ASCII characters. If the `x-ms-client-request-id` header isn't present in the request, it won't be present in the response.|
  
### Response body

None.  
  
## Authorization

Only the account owner or a caller that has a share-level shared access signature with write and delete authorization may call this operation.

## Remarks

To make the SDDL format portable across domain and non-domain joined machines, the caller can use the ConvertSecurityDescriptorToStringSecurityDescriptor() Windows function to get the base SDDL string for the security descriptor. The caller can then replace the SDDL notation that's listed in the following table with the correct SID value.
