# Get Account Information

The `Get Account Information` operation returns the sku name and account kind for the specified account.  
The `Get Account Information` operation is available on service versions beginning with version `2018-03-28`.
  
## Request  
 The `Get Account Information` request may be constructed using a valid request that is authorized using Shared Key or SAS authorization.  
 By adding a restype value of `account` and comp value of `properties`, the request will use the `Get Account Information` API. An example is shown.

For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KiB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled.

For more information, see [About Storage Analytics Logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md).|  

### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.  
  
### Status Code

|Response header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Version 2009-09-19 and newer. Indicates the version of the Blob service used to execute the request.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
|`Content-Length`| The length of the request body. For this operation, the content length will always be zero.|  
|`x-ms-sku-name`|This header identifies the [sku name](../storagerp/SRP_SKU_Types.md) of the specified account.|  
|`x-ms-account-kind`|This header identifies the [account kind](../storagerp/SRP_SKU_Types.md) of the specified account. The possible values are `Storage`, `BlobStorage`, and `StorageV2`. Please note that we distinguish between GPv1 and GPv2 storage accounts with the substring, `V2`, for GPv2 accounts.|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|This header can be used to troubleshoot requests and corresponding responses. The value of this header is equal to the value of the `x-ms-client-request-id` header if it is present in the request and the value is at most 1024 visible ASCII characters. If the `x-ms-client-request-id` header is not present in the request, this header will not be present in the response.|  
|`x-ms-is-hns-enabled`|Version 2019-07-07 and newer. This header indicates if the account has a hierarchical namespace enabled.|  

### Response Body

### Sample Response  
  
```  
Response Status:  
HTTP/1.1 200 OK  
  
Response Headers:  
Date: Sat, 28 Mar 2018 12:43:08 GMT  
x-ms-version: 2018-03-28  
Server: Windows-Azure-Blob/1.0 Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0

x-ms-sku-name: Standard_LRS  
x-ms-account-kind: StorageV2  
```  
  
## Authorization  
 This operation may be authorized with:
 - Shared Key
 - A valid account or service SAS with at least one available permission

 Note: OAuth-based authorization via an Access Token from AAD/MSI or a User Delegation SAS is not supported with this API.
  
## Remarks  
 The URL path of the request does not affect the information given by this operation. Its purpose is to allow the request to correctly authorize with a SAS token that specifies the allowed resource.  
 The resource specified need not exist for this operation to succeed. For example, a SAS token generated with a non-existent blob and valid permissions will succeed with a URL path that includes the correct account name, the correct container name, and the non-existent blob's name.
