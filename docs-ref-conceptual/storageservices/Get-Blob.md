# Get Blob
The `Get Blob` operation reads or downloads a blob from the system, including its metadata and properties. You can also call `Get Blob` to read a snapshot.  
  
## Request  
 The `Get Blob` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace *myaccount* with the name of your storage account:  
  
||GET Method Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|-|----------------------------|------------------|  
||`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob`<br /><br /> `https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?snapshot=<DateTime>`|HTTP/1.0<br /><br /> HTTP/1.1|  
  
### Emulated storage service URI  
 When making a request against the emulated storage service, specify the emulator hostname and Blob service port as `127.0.0.1:10000`, followed by the emulated storage account name:  
  
||GET Method Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|-|----------------------------|------------------|  
||`http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1/mycontainer/myblob`|HTTP/1.0<br /><br /> HTTP/1.1|  
  
 For more information, see [Using the Azure Storage Emulator for Development and Testing](/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator).  
  
### URI parameters  
 The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`snapshot`|Optional. The snapshot parameter is an opaque `DateTime` value that, when present, specifies the blob snapshot to retrieve. For more information on working with blob snapshots, see [Creating a Snapshot of a Blob](Creating-a-Snapshot-of-a-Blob.md).|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Blob Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authorized requests, optional for anonymous requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`Range`|Optional. Return only the bytes of the blob in the specified range.|  
|`x-ms-range`|Optional. Return only the bytes of the blob in the specified range. If both `Range` and `x-ms-range` are specified, the service uses the value of `x-ms-range`. If neither are specified, the entire blob contents are returned. See [Specifying the Range Header for Blob Service Operations](Specifying-the-Range-Header-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md) for more information.|  
|`x-ms-lease-id: <ID>`|Optional. If this header is specified, the operation will be performed only if both of the following conditions are met:<br /><br /> -   The blob's lease is currently active.<br />-   The lease ID specified in the request matches that of the blob.<br /><br /> If this header is specified and both of these conditions are not met, the request will fail and the `Get Blob` operation will fail with status code 412 (Precondition Failed).|  
|`x-ms-range-get-content-md5: true`|Optional. When this header is set to `true` and specified together with the `Range` header, the service returns the MD5 hash for the range, as long as the range is less than or equal to 4 MiB in size.<br /><br /> If this header is specified without the `Range` header, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).<br /><br /> If this header is set to `true` when the range exceeds 4 MiB in size, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).|  
|`x-ms-range-get-content-crc64: true`|Optional. When this header is set to `true` and specified together with the `Range` header, the service returns the CRC64 hash for the range, as long as the range is less than or equal to 4 MiB in size.<br /><br /> If this header is specified without the `Range` header, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).<br /><br /> If this header is set to `true` when the range exceeds 4 MiB in size, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).<br /><br /> If both `x-ms-range-get-content-md5` and `x-ms-range-get-content-crc64` headers are present, the request will fail with a 400 (Bad Request).<br /><br />This header is supported in versions 2019-02-02 or later.|  
|`Origin`|Optional. Specifies the origin from which the request is issued. The presence of this header results in cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) headers on the response.|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KiB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage Analytics Logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure Logging: Using Logs to Track Storage Requests](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|  
  
 This operation also supports the use of conditional headers to read the blob only if a specified condition is met. For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](Specifying-Conditional-Headers-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).  
  
### Request Headers (Customer-provided encryption keys)
  
Beginning with version 2019-02-02, the following headers may be specified on the request to read a blob encrypted with a customer-provided key. Encryption with a customer-provided key (and the corresponding set of headers) is optional. If a blob has previously been encrypted with a customer-provided key, then these headers must be included on the request to complete the read operation successfully.
  
|Request header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-encryption-key`|Required. The Base64-encoded AES-256 encryption key.|  
|`x-ms-encryption-key-sha256`|Optional. The Base64-encoded SHA256 hash of the encryption key.|  
|`x-ms-encryption-algorithm: AES256`|Required. Specifies the algorithm to use for encryption. The value of this header must be `AES256`.|  
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code, a set of response headers, and the response body, which contains the contents of the blob.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation to read the full blob returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
 A successful operation to read a specified range returns status code 206 (Partial Content).  
  
 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Syntax|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`Last-Modified`|The date/time that the blob was last modified. The date format follows RFC 1123.<br /><br /> Any operation that modifies the blob, including an update of the blob's metadata or properties, changes the last-modified time of the blob.|  
|`x-ms-creation-time`|Version 2017-11-09 and newer. The date/time at which the blob was created. The date format follows RFC 1123.|  
|`x-ms-meta-name:value`|A set of name-value pairs associated with this blob as user-defined metadata.|  
|`Content-Length`|The number of bytes present in the response body.|  
|`Content-Type`|The content type specified for the blob. The default content type is `application/octet-stream`.|  
|`Content-Range`|Indicates the range of bytes returned in the event that the client requested a subset of the blob by setting the `Range` request header.|  
|`ETag`|The ETag contains a value that you can use to perform operations conditionally. See [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](Specifying-Conditional-Headers-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md) for more information. If the request version is 2011-08-18 or newer, the ETag value will be in quotes.|  
|`Content-MD5`|If the blob has an MD5 hash and this `Get Blob` operation is to read the full blob, this response header is returned so that the client can check for message content integrity.<br /><br /> In version 2012-02-12 and newer, `Put Blob` sets a block blob’s MD5 hash value even when the `Put Blob` request doesn’t include an MD5 header.<br /><br /> If the request is to read a specified range and the `x-ms-range-get-content-md5` is set to `true`, then the request returns an MD5 hash for the range, as long as the range size is less than or equal to 4 MiB.<br /><br /> If neither of these sets of conditions is true, then no value is returned for the `Content-MD5` header.<br /><br /> If `x-ms-range-get-content-md5` is specified without the `Range` header, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).<br /><br /> If `x-ms-range-get-content-md5` is set to `true` when the range exceeds 4 MiB in size, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).|  
|`x-ms-content-crc64`|If the request is to read a specified range and the `x-ms-range-get-content-crc64` is set to `true`, then the request returns an CRC64 hash for the range, as long as the range size is less than or equal to 4 MiB. <br /><br /> If `x-ms-range-get-content-crc64` is specified without the `Range` header, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).<br /><br /> If `x-ms-range-get-content-crc64` is set to `true` when the range exceeds 4 MiB in size, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).|  
|`Content-Encoding`|This header returns the value that was specified for the `Content-Encoding` request header.|  
|`Content-Language`|This header returns the value that was specified for the `Content-Language` request header.|  
|`Cache-Control`|This header is returned if it was previously specified for the blob.|  
|`Content-Disposition`|Returned for requests against version 2013-08-15 and later. This header returns the value that was specified for the `x-ms-blob-content-disposition` header.<br /><br /> The `Content-Disposition` response header field conveys additional information about how to process the response payload, and also can be used to attach additional metadata. For example, if set to `attachment`, it indicates that the user-agent should not display the response, but instead show a **Save As** dialog with a filename other than the blob name specified.|  
|`x-ms-blob-sequence-number`|The current sequence number for a page blob.<br /><br /> This header is not returned for block blobs or append blobs.|  
|<code>x-ms-blob-type: <BlockBlob &#124; PageBlob &#124; AppendBlob></code>|Returns the blob's type.|  
|`x-ms-copy-completion-time: <datetime>`|Version 2012-02-12 and newer. Conclusion time of the last attempted `Copy Blob` operation where this blob was the destination blob. This value can specify the time of a completed, aborted, or failed copy attempt. This header does not appear if a copy is pending, if this blob has never been the destination in a `Copy Blob` operation, or if this blob has been modified after a concluded `Copy Blob` operation using `Set Blob Properties`, `Put Blob`, or `Put Block List`.|  
|`x-ms-copy-status-description: <error string>`|Version 2012-02-12 and newer. Only appears when `x-ms-copy-status` is `failed` or `pending`. Describes the cause of the last fatal or non-fatal copy operation failure. This header does not appear if this blob has never been the destination in a `Copy Blob` operation, or if this blob has been modified after a concluded `Copy Blob` operation using `Set Blob Properties`, `Put Blob`, or `Put Block List`.|  
|`x-ms-copy-id: <id>`|Version 2012-02-12 and newer. String identifier for the last attempted `Copy Blob` operation where this blob was the destination blob. This header does not appear if this blob has never been the destination in a `Copy Blob` operation, or if this blob has been modified after a concluded `Copy Blob` operation using `Set Blob Properties`, `Put Blob`, or `Put Block List`.|  
|`x-ms-copy-progress: <bytes copied/bytes total>`|Version 2012-02-12 and newer. Contains the number of bytes copied and the total bytes in the source in the last attempted `Copy Blob` operation where this blob was the destination blob. Can show between 0 and `Content-Length` bytes copied. This header does not appear if this blob has never been the destination in a `Copy Blob` operation, or if this blob has been modified after a concluded `Copy Blob` operation using `Set Blob Properties`, `Put Blob`, or `Put Block List`.|  
|`x-ms-copy-source: url`|Version 2012-02-12 and newer. URL up to 2 KiB in length that specifies the source blob or file used in the last attempted `Copy Blob` operation where this blob was the destination blob. This header does not appear if this blob has never been the destination in a `Copy Blob` operation, or if this blob has been modified after a concluded `Copy Blob` operation using `Set Blob Properties`, `Put Blob`, or `Put Block List`. <br /><br />The URL returned in this header contains any request parameters used in the copy operation on the source blob, including the SAS token used to access the source blob.|  
|<code>x-ms-copy-status: <pending &#124; success &#124; aborted &#124; failed></code>|Version 2012-02-12 and newer. State of the copy operation identified by x-ms-copy-id, with these values:<br /><br /> -   `success`: Copy completed successfully.<br />-   `pending`: Copy is in progress. Check `x-ms-copy-status-description` if intermittent, non-fatal errors slow copy progress but don’t cause failure.<br />-   `aborted`: Copy was ended by `Abort Copy Blob`.<br />-   `failed`: Copy failed. See x-ms-copy-status-description for failure details.<br /><br /> This header does not appear if this blob has never been the destination in a `Copy Blob` operation, or if this blob has been modified after a completed `Copy Blob` operation using `Set Blob Properties`, `Put Blob`, or `Put Block List`.|  
|<code>x-ms-lease-duration: <infinite &#124; fixed></code>|Version 2012-02-12 and newer. When a blob is leased, specifies whether the lease is of infinite or fixed duration.|

|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the Blob service used to execute the request. Included for requests made using version 2009-09-19 and newer.<br /><br /> This header is also returned for anonymous requests without a version specified if the container was marked for public access using the 2009-09-19 version of the Blob service.|  
|`Accept-Ranges: bytes`|Indicates that the service supports requests for partial blob content. Included for requests made using version 2011-08-18 and newer, and for the local storage service in SDK version 1.6 or newer.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
|`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`|Returned if the request includes an `Origin` header and CORS is enabled with a matching rule. This header returns the value of the origin request header in case of a match.|  
|`Access-Control-Expose-Headers`|Returned if the request includes an `Origin` header and CORS is enabled with a matching rule. Returns the list of response headers that are to be exposed to the client or issuer of the request.|  
|`Vary`|Returned with the value of the `Origin` header when CORS rules are specified. See [CORS Support for the Storage Services](Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing--CORS--Support-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md) for details.|  
|`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`|Returned if the request includes an `Origin` header and CORS is enabled with a matching rule that doesn’t allow all origins. This header will be set to true.|  
|`x-ms-blob-committed-block-count`|The number of committed blocks present in the blob. This header is returned only for append blobs.|  
|`x-ms-server-encrypted: true/false`|Version 2015-12-11 or newer.

|`x-ms-encryption-key-sha256`|Version 2019-02-02 or newer. This header is returned if the blob is encrypted with a customer-provided key.|  
|`x-ms-blob-content-md5`|Starting from version 2016-05-31, if the blob has a MD5 hash, and if request contains range header (Range or x-ms-range), this response header is returned with the value of the whole blob’s MD5 value. This value may or may not be equal to the value returned in Content-MD5 header, with the latter calculated from the requested range.|
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|This header can be used to troubleshoot requests and corresponding responses. The value of this header is equal to the value of the `x-ms-client-request-id` header if it is present in the request and the value is at most 1024 visible ASCII characters. If the `x-ms-client-request-id` header is not present in the request, this header will not be present in the response.|  
  
### Response Body  
 The response body contains the content of the blob.

```  
  
## Authorization  
 If the container's access control list (ACL) is set to allow anonymous access to the blob, any client may call this operation. If the container is private, this operation can be performed by the account owner and by anyone with a Shared Access Signature that has permission to read the blob.  
  
## Remarks  
 For a page blob, a `Get Blob` operation over a range of pages that do not yet have content or that have been cleared returns zeros for those bytes.  
  
 If you call `Get Blob` on a page blob with no range specified, the service returns the range of pages up to the value specified for the `x-ms-blob-content-length` header. For any pages lacking content, the service returns zeros for those bytes.  
  
 For an append blob, the `Get Blob` operation returns `x-ms-blob-committed-block-count` header. This header indicates the number of committed blocks in the blob. The `x-ms-blob-committed-block-count` header is not returned for block blobs or page blobs.  
  
 A `Get Blob` operation is allowed 2 minutes per MiB to complete. If the operation is taking longer than 2 minutes per MiB on average, the operation will time out.  
  
 The `x-ms-version` header is required to retrieve a blob that belongs to a private container. If the blob belongs to a container that is available for full or partial public access, any client can read it without specifying a version; the service version is not required for retrieving a blob that belongs to a public container. See [Restrict Access to Containers and Blobs](/azure/storage/storage-manage-access-to-resources) for more information.  
  
 A `Get Blob` on an archived block blob will fail.

 **Copy operations**  
  
 To determine if a `Copy Blob` operation has completed, first check that the `x-ms-copy-id` header value of the destination blob matches the copy ID provided by the original call to `Copy Blob`. A match assures that another application did not abort the copy and start a new `Copy Blob` operation. Then check for the `x-ms-copy-status: success` header. However, be aware that all write operations on a blob except `Lease`, `Put Page` and `Put Block` operations remove all `x-ms-copy-*` properties from the blob. These properties are also not copied by `Copy Blob` operations that use versions before 2012-02-12.  

> [!WARNING]
> The URL returned in the `x-ms-copy-source` header contains any request parameters used in the copy operation on the source blob. If a SAS token is used to access the source blob, then that SAS token will appear in the the `x-ms-copy-source` header when `Get Blob` is called on the destination blob.
  
 When `x-ms-copy-status: failed` appears in the response, `x-ms-copy-status-description` contains more information about the `Copy Blob` failure.  
  
 The following table describes the three fields of every `x-ms-copy-status-description` value.  
  
|Component|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|HTTP status code|Standard 3-digit integer specifying the failure.|  
|Error code|Keyword describing error that is provided by Azure in the <ErrorCode\> element. If no <ErrorCode\> element appears, a keyword containing standard error text associated with the 3-digit HTTP status code in the HTTP specification is used. See [Common REST API Error Codes](Common-REST-API-Error-Codes.md).|  
|Information|Detailed description of failure, in quotes.|  
  
 The following table describes the `x-ms-copy-status` and `x-ms-copy-status-description` values of common failure scenarios.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Description text shown here can change without warning, even without a version change, so do not rely on matching this exact text.  
  
|Scenario|x-ms-copy-status value|x-ms-copy-status-description value|  
|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
|Copy operation completed successfully.|success|empty|  
|User aborted copy operation before it completed.|aborted|empty|  
|A failure occurred when reading from the source blob during a copy operation, but the operation will be retried.|pending|502 BadGateway "Encountered a retryable error when reading the source. Will retry. Time of failure: <time\>"|  
|A failure occurred when writing to the destination blob of a copy operation, but the operation will be retried.|pending|500 InternalServerError "Encountered a retryable error. Will retry. Time of failure: <time\>"|  
|An unrecoverable failure occurred when reading from the source blob of a copy operation.|failed|404 ResourceNotFound "Copy failed when reading the source."<br /><br />**Note:**  When reporting this underlying error, Azure returns `ResourceNotFound` in the `ErrorCode` element. If no `ErrorCode` element appeared in the response, a standard string representation of the HTTP status such as `NotFound` would appear.|  
|The timeout period limiting all copy operations elapsed. (Currently the timeout period is 2 weeks.)|failed|500 OperationCancelled "The copy exceeded the maximum allowed time."|  
|The copy operation failed too often when reading from the source, and didn’t meet a minimum ratio of attempts to successes. (This timeout prevents retrying a very poor source over 2 weeks before failing).|failed|500 OperationCancelled "The copy failed when reading the source."|
