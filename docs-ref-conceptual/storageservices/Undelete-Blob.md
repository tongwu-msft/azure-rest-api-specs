# Undelete Blob

The `Undelete Blob` operation restores the contents and metadata of a soft deleted blob and any associated soft deleted snapshots.

Undelete Blob is supported only on version 2017-07-29 or later.  
  
## Request  
 The `Undelete Blob` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace *myaccount* with the name of your storage account:  
  
||PUT Method Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|-|----------------------------|------------------|  
||`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=undelete`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### Emulated Storage Service URI  
 When making a request against the emulated storage service, specify the emulator hostname and Blob service port as `127.0.0.1:10000`, followed by the emulated storage account name:  
  
||PUT Method Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|-|----------------------------|------------------|  
||`http://127.0.0.1:10000/ devstoreaccount1/mycontainer/myblob?comp=undelete`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
 For more information, see [Using the Azure Storage Emulator for Development and Testing](/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator).  
  
### URI Parameters  
 The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Blob Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request Headers (All Blob Types)  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers for all blob types.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authorized requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|    
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage Analytics Logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure Logging: Using Logs to Track Storage Requests](https://blogs.msdn.com.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Syntax|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the Blob service used to execute the request.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|This header can be used to troubleshoot requests and corresponding responses. The value of this header is equal to the value of the `x-ms-client-request-id` header if it is present in the request and the value is at most 1024 visible ASCII characters. If the `x-ms-client-request-id` header is not present in the request, this header will not be present in the response.|  
  
### Response Body  
 None.  
  
## Authorization  
 This operation can only be called by the account owner and by anyone with a Shared Access Signature that has permission to write to this blob or its container.  
  
## Remarks  
When a soft deleted blob is undeleted, the blob and any associated snapshots are available for operations using other APIs. Undelete request to blob, undeletes soft deleted blob and any associated soft deleted snapshots. Attempting to undelete a blob that is not soft deleted nor has any soft deleted snapshots will succeed without any changes.
