# Blob Batch

The `Blob Batch` operation allows multiple API calls to be embedded into a single HTTP request. This API supports two types of subrequests: [Set Blob Tier](set-blob-tier.md) for block blobs and [Delete Blob](Delete-Blob.md). The response returned by the server for a batch request contains the results for each subrequest in the batch. The batch request and response uses the syntax of OData batch processing specification with modifications to semantics. This API is available starting in version `2018-11-09`.
  
## Request  
 The `Blob Batch` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace *myaccount* with the name of your storage account:  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|
|------------|-----------------|------------------|
|`POST`|`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/?comp=batch`<br /><br /> `https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/containername?restype=container&comp=batch`|HTTP/1.1| 
  
### URI parameters

The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.

|Parameter|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|`timeout`|Optional. The timeout parameter is expressed in seconds with a maximum value of 120 seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Blob Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).|
|`restype`|Optional, version 2020-04-08 and newer. The only value supported for the `restype` parameter is *container*. When this parameter is specified, the URI must include the container name. Any sub-requests must be scoped to the same container.|

### Request Headers
The following table describes required and optional request headers.

|Request Header|Description|
|------------|-----------------|
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, storage account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authorized requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. This version will be used for all subrequests. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`Content-Length`|Required. The length of the request.|  
|`Content-Type`|Required. The value of this header must be `multipart/mixed` with a batch boundary. Example header value: `multipart/mixed; boundary=batch_a81786c8-e301-4e42-a729-a32ca24ae252`|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1-kB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage Analytics Logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure Logging: Using Logs to Track Storage Requests](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|  

### Request Body
The request body for a blob batch contains a list of all subrequests. The format uses the syntax of the OData batch specification with modifications to semantics. The request body starts with a batch boundary followed by two mandatory headers: `Content-Type` header with value `application/http` and `Content-Transfer-Encoding` with value `binary`. This is followed by an optional `Content-ID` header with a string value to track each of the subrequests. The response will contain the `Content-ID` header for each corresponding subrequest response to use for tracking. These request headers are followed by a mandatory empty line and then the definition for each subrequest. The body of each subrequest is a complete HTTP request with verb, URL, headers, and body needed for the request. Note the following caveats: 

* The subrequests should not have the `x-ms-version header`. All subrequests will be executed with the top-level batch request version. 
* The subrequest URL should only have the path of the URL (i.e without the host).
* Each batch request supports a maximum of 256 subrequests.
* All subrequests must be of the same request type.
* Each subrequest will be authorized separately with the provided information in the subrequest.
* Each line in the request body should end with \r\n characters.

## Response
The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers for the top level batch request and response information for all of its subrequests.

### Response Body
 The batch response is a multipart/mixed response which contains the response for each subrequest. The response is chunked. Each subresponse starts with the `Content-Type: application/http` header. The Content-ID header follows, if it was provided in the request. This is followed by the HTTP response status code and response headers for each subrequest.

### Status Code
If the batch request is well-formed and authorized then the operation returns status code 202 (Accepted). Each subrequest will have its own response depending on the outcome of the operation. The subrequest status will be returned in the response body.

For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).
### Response Headers
The response for this operation includes the headers below. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).

## Authorization
When `restype=container` is omitted, the parent batch request must be authorized via Shared Key, by using either the account access key or an account SAS. When `restype=container` is included on the request, then the parent batch request may be authorized via either Shared Key or Azure Active Directory, or with a SAS that is signed by either of those authorization mechanisms.

Each sub-request is authorized separately. A sub-request supports the same authorization mechanisms that the operation supports when it is not part of a batch operation.

## Billing
The batch REST request will be counted as one transaction and each individual subrequest will also be counted as one transaction.

## Remarks
One of the main benefits of using a batch request is the reduction in the number of connections a client has to open. Note the following restrictions:
  * Only supports Set Blob Tier for block blobs and Delete Blob as subrequests in the batch. 
  * Only supports up to 256 subrequests in a single batch. The size of the body for a batch request cannot exceed 4MB. 
  * An empty batch request will fail with http status code 400 (BadRequest). 
  * There are no guarantees on the order of execution of the batch subrequests. 
  * Batch subrequest execution is not atomic. Each subrequest is executed independently. 
  * Each subrequest must be for a resource within the same storage account. A single batch request does not support executing requests from different storage accounts.
  * A nested request body is not supported.
  * If the server fails to parse the request body, the result is a failure of the entire batch and no request will be executed.
  * Note that [Account SAS](create-account-sas.md) is the only SAS type supported by Blob Batch when batch is not using `restype=container`.

**Scope all subrequests to specific container**
Beginning with REST version 2020-04-08, the Blob Batch API supports scoping sub-requests to a specified container. When the request URI includes the container name and the `restype=container` parameter, then each sub-request must apply to the same container. If the container name specified for a sub-request does not match the container name provided in URI, then the request will fail with error code 400 (Bad Request).

All authorization mechanisms supported for a container are valid for a Blob Batch operation that is scoped to the container. Each sub-request sends an Authorization header to the service.
