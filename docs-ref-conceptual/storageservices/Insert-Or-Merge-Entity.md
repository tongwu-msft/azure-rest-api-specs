# Insert Or Merge Entity
The `Insert Or Merge Entity` operation updates an existing entity or inserts a new entity if it does not exist in the table. Because this operation can insert or update an entity, it is also known as an *upsert* operation.  
  
## Request  
 The `Insert Or Merge Entity` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace the following values with your own:  
  
-   `myaccount` with the name of your storage account  
  
-   `mytable` with the name of your table  
  
-   `myPartitionKey` and `myRowKey` with the name of the partition key and row key for entity to be updated  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`MERGE`|`https://myaccount.table.core.windows.net/mytable(PartitionKey='myPartitionKey', RowKey='myRowKey')`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### Emulated Storage Service  
 When making a request against the emulated storage service, specify the emulator hostname and Table service port as 127.0.0.1:10002, followed by the emulated storage account name.  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`MERGE`|`http://127.0.0.1:10002/devstoreaccount1/mytable(PartitionKey='myPartitionKey', RowKey='myRowKey')`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
 The Table service in the storage emulator differs from the Windows® Azure™ Table service in several ways. For more information, see [Differences Between the Storage Emulator and Azure Storage Services](/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator#differences-between-the-storage-emulator-and-azure-storage).  
  
### URI Parameters  
 The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`timeout`|Optional. The timeout parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Table Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Table-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authentication scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authentication for the Azure Storage Services](authorization-for-the-azure-storage-services.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authentication for the Azure Storage Services](authorization-for-the-azure-storage-services.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required. Must be set to 2011-08-18 or newer. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`Content-Type`|Required. Specifies the content type of the payload. Possible values are `application/atom+xml` and `application/json`.<br /><br /> For more formation about valid content types, see [Payload Format for Table Service Operations](Payload-Format-for-Table-Service-Operations.md).|  
|`Content-Length`|Required. The length of the request body.|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage Analytics Logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure Logging: Using Logs to Track Storage Requests](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|  
  
### Request Body  
 The `Insert Or Merge Entity` operation sends the entity to be inserted as an OData entity set, which may be either an Atom or JSON payload. For more information, see [Inserting and Updating Entities](Inserting-and-Updating-Entities.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  JSON is the recommended payload format, and is the only format supported for versions 2015-12-11 and later.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 204 (`No Content`).

## Remarks  
 The `Insert Or Merge Entity` operation uses the MERGE verb and must be called using the 2011-08-18 version or newer. In addition, it does not use the If-Match header. These attributes distinguish this operation from the `Update Entity` operation, though the request body is the same for both operations.  
  
 If the `Insert Or Merge Entity` operation is used to merge an entity, any properties from the previous entity will be retained if the request does not define or include them. Properties with a null value will also be retained.  
  
 When calling the `Insert or Merge Entity` operation, you must specify values for the `PartitionKey` and `RowKey` system properties. Together, these properties form the primary key and must be unique within the table.  
  
 Both the `PartitionKey` and `RowKey` values must be string values; each key value may be up to 64 KB in size. If you are using an integer value for the key value, you should convert the integer to a fixed-width string, because they are canonically sorted. For example, you should convert the value `1` to `0000001` to ensure proper sorting.  
  
 To explicitly type a property, specify the appropriate OData type by setting the `m:type` attribute within the property definition in the Atom feed. For more information about typing properties, see [Inserting and Updating Entities](Inserting-and-Updating-Entities.md).  
  
 Any application that can authenticate and send an HTTP MERGE request can insert or update an entity.  
  
 For information about performing batch upsert operations, see [Performing Entity Group Transactions](Performing-Entity-Group-Transactions.md).
