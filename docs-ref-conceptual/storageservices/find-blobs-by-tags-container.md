# Find Blobs by Tags
The `Find Blobs by Tags` operation finds all blobs in the container whose tags match a given search expression.  
  
## Request  
 The `Find Blobs by Tags` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace *myaccount* with the name of your storage account and *mycontainer* with name of your storage container:  
  
|GET Method Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------------------------------|------------------|  
|`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer?restype=container&comp=blobs&where=<expression>`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### URI parameters
  
 The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`expression`|Required. Filters the result set to only include blobs whose tags match the specified expression. <br /><br /> See the Remarks for more information on how to construct this expression.|  
|`marker`|Optional. A string value that identifies the portion of the result set to be returned with the next operation. The operation returns a marker value within the response body if the result set returned was not complete. The marker value may then be used in a subsequent call to request the next set of items.<br /><br /> The marker value is opaque to the client.|  
|`maxresults`|Optional. Specifies the maximum number of blobs to return. If the request does not specify `maxresults` or specifies a value greater than 5,000, the server will return up to 5,000 items.<br /><br /> Setting `maxresults` to a value less than or equal to zero results in error response code 400 (Bad Request).|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Blob Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authorized requests, optional for anonymous requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KiB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage Analytics Logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure Logging: Using Logs to Track Storage Requests](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|  
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code, response headers, and response body.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Response header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`Content-Type`|`application/xml`|  
|`Content-Length`|The size of the returned XML document, in bytes|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the Blob service used to execute the request.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|This header can be used to troubleshoot requests and corresponding responses. The value of this header is equal to the value of the `x-ms-client-request-id` header if it is present in the request and the value is at most 1024 visible ASCII characters. If the `x-ms-client-request-id` header is not present in the request, this header will not be present in the response.|  
  
### Response Body  
The format of the response body is as follows:  
  
```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<EnumerationResults ServiceEndpoint=http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/>  
  <Where>string-value</Where>  
  <Blobs>  
    <Blob>  
      <Name>blob-name</Name>  
      <ContainerName>container-name</ContainerName>  
      <Tags>
        <TagSet>
          <Tag>
            <Key>matching-tag-name1</Key>
            <Value>matching-tag-value1</Value>
          </Tag>
          <Tag>
            <Key>matching-tag-name2</Key>
            <Value>matching-tag-value2</Value>
          </Tag>
        </TagSet>
      </Tags> 
    </Blob>  
  </Blobs>  
  <NextMarker />  
</EnumerationResults>  
```
  
 The response body is a well-formed UTF-8 XML document.
  
## Authorization  
 This operation can be called by the account owner and by anyone with a Shared Access Signature that has permission to find blobs by tags (the `f` SAS permission).  
  
 In addition, RBAC users with the `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/filter/action` permission can perform this operation.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Find Blobs by Tags` operation on container is supported in REST API version 2021-04-10 and later.  
  
  The secondary index used by `Find Blobs by Tags` is eventually consistent. Updates to blob tags via `Set Blob Tags` many not be immediately visible to `Find Blobs by Tags` operations.  
  
### Constructing a Search Expression
  
 The `where` URI parameter finds blobs in the storage account and container whose tags match a given expression. The expression must evaluate to `true` for a blob to be returned in the result set.
  
 The storage service supports a subset of the ANSI SQL WHERE clause grammar for the value of the `where=<expression>` query parameter. The following operators are supported:
  
|Operator|Description|Example|  
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
|`=`|Equal|`&where=Status = 'In Progress'`|  
|`>`|Greater than|`&where=LastModified > '2018-06-18 20:51:26Z'`|  
|`>=`|Greater than or equal|`&where=Priority >= '05'`|  
|`<`|Less than|`&where=Age < '032'`|  
|`<=`|Less than or equal|`&where=Reviewer <= 'Smith'`|  
|`AND`|Logical and|`&where=Name > 'C' AND Name < 'D'`<br />`&where=Age > '032' AND Age < '100'`|  
  
 **Note:** the value of the `where` URI parameter must be properly URI encoded (including spaces and operators). The examples above omit this for readability. @container is not supported when container is part of URI.

 All tag values are strings, and the supported binary relational operators use a lexicographic sorting of the tag values. To support non-string data types, including numbers and dates, appropriate padding and sortable formatting must be employed.  Tag values must be enclosed in single quotes.  
  
 If tag names are regular SQL identifiers, they may be present without escaping; if they contain any special characters, they must be delimited with double quotes (e.g. "TagName" = 'TagValue'). It is recommended to always enclose tag names in double quotes.  
  
 The storage service will reject any request that contains an invalid expression with error code 400 (Bad Request).
