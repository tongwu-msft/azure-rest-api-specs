# Get User Delegation Key

The `Get User Delegation Key` operation gets a key that can be used to generate a user delegation SAS (shared access signature). A user delegation SAS grants access to resources in the Blob service to a user with Azure Active Directory credentials. The `Get User Delegation Key` operation is available in version 2018-11-09 and later.  
  
## Request

Construct the `Get User Delegation Key` as follows. HTTPS is required. Replace `myaccount` with the name of your storage account.  
  
|POST Method Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|----------------------------|------------------|  
|`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/?restype=service&comp=userdelegationkey`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### Emulated Storage Service URI  

When making a request against the local storage service, specify the local hostname and Blob service port as `127.0.0.1:10000`, followed by the local storage account name:  
  
|POST Method Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|----------------------------|------------------|  
|`http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1/?restype=service&comp=userdelegationkey`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
For more information, see [Using the Azure Storage Emulator for Development and Testing](/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator).  
  
### URI Parameters  

The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Blob Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request Headers  

The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authorization scheme. Only authorization with Azure Active Directory is supported. For more information, see [Authenticate with Azure Active Directory](authenticate-with-azure-active-directory.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authorized requests. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage Analytics Logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure Logging: Using Logs to Track Storage Requests](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<KeyInfo>  
    <Start>String, formatted ISO Date</Start>
    <Expiry>String, formatted ISO Date </Expiry>
</KeyInfo>  
```
