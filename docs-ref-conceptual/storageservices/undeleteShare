# Undelete Share
The `Undelete Share` operation undeletes a share that had previously been soft-deleted. 
  
The share resource includes metadata and properties for that share. It does not include a list of the files contained by the share.  
  
## Request  
 The `Undelete Share` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended.  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`PUT`|`https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/restoredShareName?restype=share&comp=undelete`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
 Replace the path components shown in the request URI with your own, as follows:  
  
|Path Component|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|*myaccount*|The name of your storage account.|  
|*restoredShareName*|The name to use for the undeleted share. If a share already exists with this name, the operation will fail.|  
  
 For details on path naming restrictions, see [Naming and Referencing Shares, Directories, Files, and Metadata](Naming-and-Referencing-Shares--Directories--Files--and-Metadata.md).  
  
### URI Parameters  
 The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The timeout parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for File Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-File-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-deleted-share-name`|Required. Identifies the the soft-deleted file share to be undeleted. This value must match the value of restoredShareName currently.|  
|`x-ms-deleted-share-version`|Required. Uniquely identifies the soft-deleted file share by its version.|  
 
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
### Sample Request  
  
```  
PUT https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myshare?restype=share&comp=undelete HTTP/1.1   

Request Headers:  
x-ms-version: 2019-12-12   
x-ms-deleted-share-name: myshare 
x-ms-deleted-share-version: 01D2AC0C18EDFE36   
Authorization: SharedKey myaccount:Z5043vY9MesKNh0PNtksNc9nbXSSqGHueE00JdjidOQ= 
```  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 201 (Created).  
 If the destination file share name is used by a valid live file share, the request will fail with a 409 (Conflict). 
 If the source file share is not soft-deleted, has already been undeleted, or if the source file share has passed its retention period and has expired, the request will fail with a 404 (Not Found).  
  
 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Response header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`ETag`|The ETag contains a value which represents the version of the share, in quotes.|  
|`Last-Modified`|Returns the date and time the share was last modified. The date format follows RFC 1123. For more information, see [Representation of Date-Time Values in Headers](Representation-of-Date-Time-Values-in-Headers.md).<br /><br /> Any operation that modifies the share or its properties or metadata updates the last modified time. Operations on files do not affect the last modified time of the share.|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md)|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the File service used to execute the request.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
  
### Response Body  
 None.  
  
### Sample Response  
  
```  
Response Status:  
HTTP/1.1 201 Created  
  
Response Headers:  
Transfer-Encoding: chunked  
Date: <date>  
ETag: "0x8CB14C3E29B7E82"  
Last-Modified: <date>  
x-ms-version: 2015-02-21  
Server: Windows-Azure-File/1.0 Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0  
```  
  
## Authorization  
 The storage account owner and users with valid Account SAS tokens may call this operation. The SAS token must include Write permissions for the Container resource to authorize this operation.
  
## Remarks  
 It is not currently possible to undelete a share to a different name. When undeleting a share, if another live share exists with the same name, the operation will fail with status code 409 (Conflict). The live share with the same name must first be deleted before the soft-deleted share can be undeleted.
