# Version 2018-11-09

The 2018-11-09 service version includes the following features.

- A new API [Put Page From URL](Put-Page-From-Url.md) allow pages in a page blob to be written using a range of another blob as a source. This permits synchronous server-side copies to be orchestrated for page blobs of any size.
- A new API [Append Block From URL](Append-Block-From-Url.md) allow blocks in an append block to be commited using a range of another blob as a source. This permits synchronous server-side copies to be orchestrated for append blobs of any size.
- A new API [Copy Blob From URL](Copy-Blob-From-Url.md) allow blocks in an append block to be commited using a range of another blob as a source. This permits synchronous server-side copies to be orchestrated for append blobs of any size.
- Shared Access Signatures can now be scoped to an individual blob snapshot resource. See [Constructing A Service SAS](Constructing-a-Service-SAS) for more information.
