# Get Blob Tags
The `Get Blob Tags` operation returns all user-defined tags for the specified blob, version, or snapshot.  
  
## Request  
 The `Get Blob Tags` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace *myaccount* with the name of your storage account:  
  
||GET Method Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|-|------------------------------------|------------------|  
||`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=tags`<br /><br /> `https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=tags&snapshot=<DateTime>`<br /><br /> `https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=tags&versionid=<DateTime>`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### URI parameters
  
 The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`snapshot`|Optional. The snapshot parameter is an opaque `DateTime` value that, when present, specifies the blob snapshot to retrieve. For more information on working with blob snapshots, see [Creating a Snapshot of a Blob](Creating-a-Snapshot-of-a-Blob.md)|  
|`versionid`|Optional for versions 2019-10-10 and newer. The versionid parameter is an opaque `DateTime` value that, when present, specifies the version of the blob to retrieve.|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Blob Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authorized requests, optional for anonymous requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage Analytics Logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure Logging: Using Logs to Track Storage Requests](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|  
  
 This operation supports the `x-ms-if-tags` conditional header to set blob tags only if a specified condition is met. For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](Specifying-Conditional-Headers-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).  
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code, response headers, and response body.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Response header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`Content-Type`|`application/xml`|  
|`Content-Length`|The size of the returned XML document, in bytes|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the Blob service used to execute the request.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|This header can be used to troubleshoot requests and corresponding responses. The value of this header is equal to the value of the `x-ms-client-request-id` header if it is present in the request and the value is at most 1024 visible ASCII characters. If the `x-ms-client-request-id` header is not present in the request, this header will not be present in the response.|  
  
### Response Body  
  
 The format of the response body is as follows:  
  
```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<Tags>  
    <TagSet>  
        <Tag>  
            <Key>tag-name-1</Key>  
            <Value>tag-value-1</Value>  
        </Tag>  
        <Tag>  
            <Key>tag-name-2</Key>  
            <Value>tag-value-2</Value>  
        </Tag>  
    </TagSet>  
</Tags>  
```
  
 The response body is a well-formed UTF-8 XML document that represents all the tags stored on the blob.  
  
## Authorization  
 This operation can be called by the account owner and by anyone with a Shared Access Signature that has permission to the blob's tags (the `t` SAS permission).  
  
 In addition, RBAC users with the `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/tags/read` permission can perform this operation.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Get Blob Tags` operation is supported in REST API version 2020-12-12 and later.  
  
 The ordering of tags is not guaranteed in the response.  
  
 The storage service maintains strong consistency between a blob and its tags, but the secondary index is eventually consistent. Tags may be visible in a response to `Get Blob Tags` before they are visible to `Find Blobs by Tags` operations.
