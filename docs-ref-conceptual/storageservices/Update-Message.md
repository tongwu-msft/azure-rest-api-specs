# Update Message

The `Update Message` operation updates the visibility timeout of a message. You can also use this operation to update the contents of a message. A message must be in a format that can be included in an XML request with UTF-8 encoding, and the encoded message can be up to 64 KB in size. This operation was introduced with version 2011-08-18 of the Azure Queue Storage API. 
  
## Request  

You can construct the `Update Message` request as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace *myaccount* with the name of your storage account, and *myqueue* with the name of your queue.  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`PUT`|`https://myaccount.queue.core.windows.net/myqueue/messages/messageid?popreceipt=<string-value>&visibilitytimeout=<int-seconds>`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### Emulated storage service  

This operation is supported for SDK 1.6 and later versions.  
  
When you make a request against the emulated storage service, specify the emulator hostname and Queue Storage port as `127.0.0.1:10001`, followed by the emulated storage account name.  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`PUT`|`http://127.0.0.1:10001/devstoreaccount1/myqueue/messages/messageid?popreceipt=<string-value>&visibilitytimeout=<int-seconds>`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### URI parameters  

You can specify the following parameters on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`popreceipt`|Required. Specifies the valid pop receipt value returned from an earlier call to the [Get Messages](Get-Messages.md) or [Update Message](Update-Message.md) operations.|  
|`visibilitytimeout`|Required. Specifies the new visibility timeout value, in seconds, relative to server time. The new value must be larger than or equal to 0, and can't be larger than 7 days. The visibility timeout of a message can't be set to a value later than the expiry time. You can update a message until it has been deleted or has expired.|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting timeouts for Queue Storage operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Queue-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request headers  

The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`Date` `or x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Requires 2011-08-18 or later. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1-kibibyte (KiB) character limit that's recorded in the Azure Monitor logs when logging is configured. We highly recommend that you use this header to correlate client-side activities with requests that the server receives. For more information, see [Monitor Azure Queue Storage](/azure/storage/queues/monitor-queue-storage).|  
  
### Request body  

The body of the request contains the message data in the following XML format. Note that the message content must be in a format that can be encoded with UTF-8.  
  
```  
<QueueMessage>  
    <MessageText>message-content</MessageText>  
</QueueMessage>  
```  
  
## Response  

The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.  
  
### Status code  

A successful operation returns status code 204 (No Content). For information about status codes, see [Status and error codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response headers  

The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response can also include additional, standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Request header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made, and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of Queue Storage used to run the request. This header is returned for requests made against version 2009-09-19 and later.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value that indicates the time at which the response was initiated. The service generates this value.|  
|`x-ms-popreceipt`|The pop receipt of the queue message.|  
|`x-ms-time-next-visible`|A UTC date/time value that represents when the message will be visible on the queue.|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|You can use this header to troubleshoot requests and corresponding responses. The value of this header is equal to the value of the `x-ms-client-request-id` header, if it's present in the request. The value is at most 1,024 visible ASCII characters. If the `x-ms-client-request-id` header isn't present in the request, this header won't be present in the response.|  
  
### Response body  

None.  
  
## Authorization  

The account owner can perform this operation. Additionally, anyone with a shared access signature who has permission to perform this operation can do so.  
  
## Sample request and response  

The following request extends the visibility of a queue message by 30 seconds and updates its content.  
  
```  
PUT https://myaccount.queue.core.windows.net/myqueue/messages/663d89aa-d1d9-42a2-9a6a-fcf822a97d2c?popreceipt=AgAAAAEAAAApAAAAGIw6Q29bzAE%3d&visibilitytimeout=30&timeout=30 HTTP/1.1  
  
```  
  
The request is sent with the following headers:  
  
```  
x-ms-version: 2011-08-18  
x-ms-date: Mon, 29 Aug 2011 17:17:21 GMT  
Authorization: SharedKey myaccount:batcrWZ35InGCZeTUFWMdIQiOZPCW7UEyeGdDOg7WW4=  
Content-Length: 75  
```  
  
The request is sent with the following XML body:  
  
```  
<QueueMessage>  
    <MessageText>new-message-content</MessageText>  
</QueueMessage>  
```  
  
After the request has been sent, the following response is returned:  
  
```  
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content  
Content-Length: 0  
Server: Windows-Azure-Queue/1.0 Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0  
x-ms-request-id: df34a7dd-3cbe-4206-a586-d6de3cf225a7  
x-ms-version: 2011-08-18  
x-ms-popreceipt: AwAAAAIAAAApAAAAINtMQ29bzAEBAAAA  
x-ms-time-next-visible: Mon, 29 Aug 2011 17:17:51 GMT  
Date: Mon, 29 Aug 2011 17:17:21 GMT  
```  
  
## Remarks  

An `Update Message` operation fails if the specified message doesn't exist in the queue, or if the specified pop receipt doesn't match the message.  
  
A pop receipt is returned by the `Get Messages` operation or the `Update Message` operation. Pop receipts remain valid until one of the following events occurs:  
  
- The message has expired.  
  
- The message has been deleted by using the last pop receipt received, either from `Get Messages` or `Update Message`.  
  
- The invisibility time has elapsed and the message has been dequeued by a `Get Messages` request. When the invisibility time elapses, the message becomes visible again. If it's retrieved by another `Get Messages` request, the returned pop receipt can be used to delete or update the message.  
  
- The message has been updated with a new visibility timeout. When the message is updated, a new pop receipt will be returned.  
  
You can use the `Update Message` operation to continually extend the invisibility of a queue message. This functionality can be useful if you want a worker role to lease a queue message. For example, if a worker role calls [Get Messages](Get-Messages.md) and recognizes that it needs more time to process a message, it can continually extend the messageâ€™s invisibility until it is processed. If the worker role were to fail during processing, eventually the message would become visible again, and another worker role could process it.
