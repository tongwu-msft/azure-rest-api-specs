## Sample Request  
  
```

Authorization: SharedKey myaccount: Z5043vY9MesKNh0PNtksNc9nbXSSqGHueE00Jdjid0Q=  
x-ms-share-quota: 55  
  
```  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.  
  
## Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
## Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=73147).  
  
|Response header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`Last-Modified`|Returns the date and time the share was last modified. The date format follows RFC 1123. For more information, see [Representation of Date-Time Values in Headers](Representation-of-Date-Time-Values-in-Headers.md). Any operation that modifies the share or its properties updates the last modified time. Operations on files do not affect the last modified time of the share.|  
|`ETag`|The ETag contains a value which represents the version of the share, as a quoted string.|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the File service used to execute the request.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
  
## Response Body  
 None.  
  
## Authorization  
 Only the account owner may call this operation.  
  
## Remarks  
 For more information on setting the share quota, see [Create Share](Create-Share.md).  
  
 If you set share quota to be smaller than the size of the data on the share, the operation will succeed. However, you will not be able to add more data to the share until the amount of the data on the share is reduced below the quota. You can reduce the amount of data by either deleting or compressing files.  
  
 `Set Share Properties` is not supported for a share snapshot. An attempt to perform this operation on a share snapshot will fail with 400 (InvalidQueryParameterValue).
