- The headers `x-ms-file-permission`, `x-ms-file-permission-key`, `x-ms-file-attributes`, `x-ms-file-creation-time`, and `x-ms-file-last-write-time` are now optional for [Create File](Create-File.md), [Create Directory](Create-Directory.md), [Set File Properties](Set-File-Properties.md), and [Set Directory Properties](set-directory-properties.md).
