# Version 2015-07-08

Version 2015-07-08 adds support for incremental snapshots for page blobs. Incremental snapshots are a cost-effective way to back up virtual machine disks if you wish to implement your own backup solution.  
  
 To support incremental snapshots, the [Get Page Ranges](Get-Page-Ranges.md) operation now exposes the `prevsnapshot` parameter, which takes a `DateTime` value indicating an existing snapshot.  Calling [Get Page Ranges](Get-Page-Ranges.md) with the `prevsnapshot` parameter returns pages that have been updated or cleared since the snapshot specified by `prevsnapshot` was taken. You can then copy the pages that are returned to a backup page blob in another storage account, using [Put Page](Put-Page.md).
