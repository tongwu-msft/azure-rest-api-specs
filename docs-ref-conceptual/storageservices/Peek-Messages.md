# Peek Messages
This operation retrieves one or more messages from the front of the queue, but does not alter the visibility of the message.  
  
## Request  
 The `Peek Messages` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace *myaccount* with the name of your storage account, and `myqueue` with the name of your queue:  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`GET`|`https://myaccount.queue.core.windows.net/myqueue/messages?peekonly=true`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### Emulated Storage Service URI  
 When making a request against the emulated storage service, specify the emulator hostname and Queue service port as `127.0.0.1:10001`, followed by the emulated storage account name:  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`GET`|`http://127.0.0.1:10001/devstoreaccount1/myqueue/messages?peekonly=true`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### URI Parameters  
 The following parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`numofmessages`|Optional. A nonzero integer value that specifies the number of messages to peek from the queue, up to a maximum of 32. By default, a single message is peeked from the queue with this operation.|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Queue Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Queue-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authentication scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authentication for the Azure Storage Services](authorization-for-the-azure-storage-services.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authentication for the Azure Storage Services](authorization-for-the-azure-storage-services.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Optional. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage Analytics Logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure Logging: Using Logs to Track Storage Requests](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|  
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code, a set of response headers, and an XML response body.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response also includes additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Response header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the Queue service used to execute the request. This header is returned for requests made against version 2009-09-19 and later.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
  
### Response Body  
 The response XML for the `Peek Messages` operation is returned in the following format.  
  
 The `MessageID` element is a GUID value that identifies the message in the queue. This value is assigned to the message by the Queue service and is opaque to the client.  
  
 The `InsertionTime` and `ExpirationTime` elements are represented as UTC values and formatted as described in RFC 1123.  
  
 The `DequeueCount` element has a value of 1 the first time the message is dequeued. This value is incremented each time the message is subsequently dequeued.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `DequeueCount` element is returned in the response body only if the queue was created with version 2009-09-19 of the Queue service.  
  
```  
<QueueMessagesList>  
    <QueueMessage>  
      <MessageId>string-message-id</MessageId>  
      <InsertionTime>insertion-time</InsertionTime>  
      <ExpirationTime>expiration-time</ExpirationTime>  
      <DequeueCount>integer</DequeueCount>  
      <MessageText>message-body</MessageText>  
    </QueueMessage>  
</QueueMessagesList>  
```  
  
 Note that this response differs from the response for the [Get Messages](Get-Messages.md) operation in that the response does not contain the `PopReceipt` or `TimeNextVisible` elements.  
  
### Sample Response

  </QueueMessage>  
</QueueMessagesList>  
```  
  
## ï»¿Authorization  
 This operation can be performed by the account owner and by anyone with a shared access signature that has permission to perform this operation.  
  
## Remarks  
 When a message is retrieved from the queue with `peekonly` set to `true`, the visibility of the message is unchanged. The message remains available to other consumers of the queue until a client retrieves the message with the [Get Messages](Get-Messages.md) operation. The client requesting the message does not receive a pop receipt with the response and therefore cannot delete the message.  
  
 Only messages that are visible may be retrieved with the `Peek Messages` operation. Note that the maximum number of messages that may be retrieved is 32.  
  
 When a message is retrieved for the first time with a call to `Get Messages`, its `DequeueCount` property is set to 1. If it is not deleted and is subsequently retrieved again, the `DequeueCount` property is incremented. The client may use this value to determine how many times a message has been retrieved. Note that a call to `Peek Messages` does not increment the value of `DequeueCount`, but returns this value for the client to read.  
  
 If the *numofmessages* parameter is out of range, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request), along with additional error information, as shown in the following example.  
  
```
