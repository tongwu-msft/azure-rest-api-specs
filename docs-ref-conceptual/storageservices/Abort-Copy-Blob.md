# Abort Copy Blob

The `Abort Copy Blob` operation stops a pending `Copy Blob` operation, and leaves a destination blob with zero length and full metadata. This operation applies to version 2012-02-12 and newer.  
  
## Request  

Construct the `Abort Copy Blob` operation as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace `myaccount` with the name of your storage account, `mycontainer` with the name of your container, and `myblob` with the name of your destination blob. Replace `<id>` with the copy identifier provided in the `x-ms-copy-id` header of the original `Copy Blob` operation.  
  
Beginning with version 2013-08-15, you can specify a shared access signature for the destination blob if it's in the same account as the source blob. Beginning with version 2015-04-05, you can also specify a shared access signature for the destination blob if it's in a different storage account.  
  
|PUT method request URI|HTTP version|  
|----------------------------|------------------|  
|`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=copy&copyid=<id>`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
### Emulated storage service URI  

When you're making a request against the local storage service, specify the local hostname and Azure Blob Storage port as `127.0.0.1:10000`, followed by the local storage account name:  
  
|PUT method request URI|HTTP version|  
|----------------------------|------------------|  
|`http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1/mycontainer/myblob?comp=copy&copyid=<id>`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
 For more information, see [Using the Azure Storage emulator for development and testing](/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator).  
  
### URI parameters  

You can specify the following additional parameter on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting timeouts for Blob Storage operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request headers  

The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authorized requests. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-lease-id:<ID>`|Required if the destination blob has an active infinite lease.|  
|`x-ms-copy-action: abort`|Required.|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value, with a 1 KiB character limit, that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage analytics logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md).|  
  
### Request body  

None.  
  
## Response  

The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.  
  
### Status code  

A successful operation returns status code 204 (*no content*). For information about status codes, see [Status and error codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response headers  

The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response can also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Response header|Description|
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made, and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of Blob Storage used to run the request.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|You can use this header to troubleshoot requests and corresponding responses. The value of this header is equal to the value of the `x-ms-client-request-id` header if it is present in the request. The value is, at most, 1024 visible ASCII characters. If the `x-ms-client-request-id` header isn't present in the request, this header isn't present in the response.|  
  
## Authorization  

Only the account owner can call this operation.  
  
## Remarks  

When you stop a pending `Copy Blob` operation, the destination blobâ€™s `x-ms-copy-status` header is set to `aborted`. Stopping a copy operation results in a destination blob of zero length for block blobs, append blobs, and page blobs. However, the metadata for the destination blob will have the new values copied from the source blob, or set explicitly in the `Copy Blob` operation call. To keep the original metadata from before the copy, make a snapshot of the destination blob before calling `Copy Blob`.  
  
 You can only stop a copy operation that is pending. Trying to stop a copy that has completed, or failed, results in a conflict error. Trying to stop a copy operation by using an incorrect copy ID also results in a conflict error.
