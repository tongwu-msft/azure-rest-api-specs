# Get File
The `Get File` operation reads or downloads a file from the system, including its metadata and properties.  
  
## Request  
 The `Get File` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended.  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`GET`|`https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myshare/mydirectorypath/myfile`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
 Replace the path components shown in the request URI with your own, as follows:  
  
|Path Component|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|*myaccount*|The name of your storage account.|  
|*myshare*|The name of your file share.|  
|*mydirectorypath*|Optional. The path to the directory.|  
|*myfile*|The name of the file.|  
  
 For details on path naming restrictions, see [Naming and Referencing Shares, Directories, Files, and Metadata](Naming-and-Referencing-Shares--Directories--Files--and-Metadata.md).  
  
### URI Parameters  
 The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for File Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-File-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authentication scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authentication for the Azure Storage Services](Authentication-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authentication for the Azure Storage Services](Authentication-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authenticated requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`Range`|Optional. Return file data only from the specified byte range.|  
|`x-ms-range`|Optional. Return file data only from the specified byte range. If both `Range` and `x-ms-range` are specified, the service uses the value of `x-ms-range`. If neither are specified, the entire file contents are returned. See [Specifying the Range Header for File Service Operations](Specifying-the-Range-Header-for-File-Service-Operations.md) for more information.|  
|`x-ms-range-get-content-md5: true`|Optional. When this header is set to `true` and specified together with the `Range` header, the service returns the MD5 hash for the range, as long as the range is less than or equal to 4 MB in size.<br /><br /> If this header is specified without the `Range` header, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).<br /><br /> If this header is set to `true` when the range exceeds 4 MB in size, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).|  
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code, a set of response headers, and the response body, which contains the contents of the file.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response may also include additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Response Header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`Last-Modified`|Returns the date and time the file was last modified. The date format follows RFC 1123. For more information, see [Representation of Date-Time Values in Headers](Representation-of-Date-Time-Values-in-Headers.md). Any operation that modifies the file or its properties updates the last modified time.|  
|`x-ms-meta-name:value`|A set of name-value pairs associated with this file as user-defined metadata.|  
|`Content-Length`|The number of bytes present in the response body.|  
|`Content-Type`|The content type specified for the file. The default content type is `application/octet-stream`.|  
|`Content-Range`|Indicates the range of bytes returned if the client requested a subset of the file by setting the `Range` request header.|  
|`ETag`|The ETag contains a value that you can use to perform operations conditionally, in quotes.|  
|`Content-MD5`|If the file has an MD5 hash and the request is to read the full file, this response header is returned so that the client can check for message content integrity.<br /><br /> If the request is to read a specified range and the `x-ms-range-get-content-md5` is set to true, then the request returns an MD5 hash for the range, as long as the range size is less than or equal to 4 MB.<br /><br /> If neither of these sets of conditions is true, then no value is returned for the `Content-MD5` header.<br /><br /> If `x-ms-range-get-content-md5` is specified without the Range header, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).<br /><br /> If `x-ms-range-get-content-md5` is set to true when the range exceeds 4 MB in size, the service returns status code 400 (Bad Request).|  
|`Content-Encoding`|This header returns the value that was specified for the `Content-Encoding` request header.|  
|`Content-Language`|This header returns the value that was specified for the `Content-Language` request header.|  
|`Cache-Control`|This header is returned if it was previously specified for the file.|  
|`Content-Disposition`|Returns the value that was specified for the `x-ms-content-disposition` header and specifies how to process the response.<br /><br /> The `Content-Disposition` response header field conveys additional information about how to process the response payload, and also can be used to attach additional metadata. For example, if set to `attachment`, `Content-Disposition` indicates that the user-agent should not display the response, but instead show a **Save As** dialog.|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the File service used to execute the request.|  
|`Accept-Ranges: bytes`|Indicates that the service supports requests for partial file content.|  
|`Date`|`Date`|  
|`x-ms-copy-completion-time:<datetime>`|Version 2015-02-21 and newer. Conclusion time of the last attempted **Copy File** operation where this file was the destination file. This value can specify the time of a completed, aborted, or failed copy attempt. This header does not appear if a copy is pending, if this file has never been the destination in a **Copy File** operation, or if this file has been modified after a concluded **Copy File** operation using **Set File Properties** or **Create File**.|  
|`x-ms-copy-status-description: <error string>`|Version 2015-02-21 and newer. Only appears when `x-ms-copy-status` is *failed* or *pending*. Describes cause of fatal or non-fatal copy operation failure. This header does not appear if this file has never been the destination in a **Copy File** operation, or if this file has been modified after a concluded **Copy File** operation using **Set File Properties** or **Create File**.|  
|`x-ms-copy-id: <id>`|Version 2015-02-21 and newer. String identifier for the last attempted **Copy File** operation where this file was the destination file. This header does not appear if the file has never been the destination in a **Copy File** operation, or if this file has been modified after a concluded **Copy File** operation using **Set File Properties** or **Create File**.|  
|`x-ms-copy-progress: <bytes copied/bytes total>`|Version 2015-02-21 and newer. Contains the number of bytes copied and the total bytes in the source in the last attempted **Copy File** operation where this file was the destination file. Can show between 0 and `Content-Length` bytes copied. This header does not appear if this file has never been the destination in a **Copy File** operation, or if this file has been modified after a concluded **Copy File** operation using **Set File Properties** or **Create File**.|  
|`x-ms-copy-source: url`|Version 2015-02-21 and newer. URL up to 2KB in length that specifies the source file used in the last attempted **Copy File** operation where this file was the destination file.

|`x-ms-copy-status: <pending &#124; success &#124; aborted &#124; failed>`|Version 2015-02-21 and newer. State of the copy operation identified by `x-ms-copy-id`, with these values:<br /><br /> -   *success:* Copy completed successfully.<br />-   *pending:* Copy is in progress. Check `x-ms-copy-status-description` if intermittent, non-fatal errors impede copy progress but don't cause failure.<br />-   *aborted:* Copy was ended by **Abort Copy File**.<br />-   *failed:* Copy failed. See `x-ms-copy-status-description` for failure details.<br /><br /> This header does not appear if this file has never been the destination in a **Copy File** operation, or if this file has been modified after a completed **Copy File** operation using **Set File Properties** or **Create File**.|  
|`x-ms-content-md5`|Starting from version 2016-05-31, if the file has a MD5 hash, and if request contains range header (Range or x-ms-range), this response header is returned with the value of the whole file’s MD5 value. This value may or may not be equal to the value returned in Content-MD5 header, with the latter calculated from the requested range.|
|`x-ms-server-encrypted: true/false`|Version 2017-04-17 or newer. The value of this header is set to `true` if the file data and application metadata are completely encrypted using the specified algorithm. Otherwise, the value is set to `false` (when the file is unencrypted, or if only parts of the file/application metadata are encrypted).|

## Authorization  
 Only the account owner may call this operation.  
  
## Remarks  
 Calling `Get File` over a range that does not yet have content or that has been cleared returns zeros for those bytes.  
  
 If you call `Get File` with no range specified, the service returns the range of bytes up to the value specified for the `x-ms-content-length` header. For any ranges lacking content, the service returns zeros for those bytes.  
  
 A `Get File` operation is allowed 2 minutes per MB to complete. Operations that take longer than 2 minutes per MB on average will time out.
