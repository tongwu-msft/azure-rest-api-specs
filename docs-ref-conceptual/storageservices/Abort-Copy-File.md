## Request
The `Abort Copy File` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended.  
  
Beginning with version 2013-08-15, you may specify a shared access signature for the destination file if it is in the same account as the source file. Beginning with version 2015-04-05, you may also specify a shared access signature for the destination file if it is in a different storage account.  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|**PUT**|`https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myshare/mydirectorypath/myfile?comp=copy&copyid=<id>`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
Replace the path components shown in the request URI with your own, as follows:  
  
|Path component|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`myaccount`|The name of your storage account.|  
|`myshare`|The name of your file share.|  
|`mydirectorypath`|Optional. The path to the parent directory.|  
|`myfile`|The name of the file.|  
  
For details on path naming restrictions, see [Naming and Referencing Shares, Directories, Files, and Metadata](Naming-and-Referencing-Shares--Directories--Files--and-Metadata.md).  
  
### URI parameters
The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The timeout parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see Setting Timeouts for File Service Operations.|  
  
### Request headers
The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authorized requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. This operation is available only in versions 2015-02-21 and later.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](versioning-for-the-azure-storage-services.md).|  
|`x-ms-copy-action:abort`|Required.| 
|`x-ms-lease-id:<ID>`|Required if the destination file has an active lease. Available for versions 2019-02-02 and later. |
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KiB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [Monitoring Azure Blob storage](/azure/storage/blobs/monitor-blob-storage).|
  
### Request body
None.  
  
## Response  
The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.  
  
### Status code  
A successful operation returns status code 204 (No Content).  
  
For information about status codes, see Status and Error Codes.  
  
### Response headers
The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response also includes additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification.  
  
|Response header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see Troubleshooting API Operations.|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the File service used to execute the request.|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|This header can be used to troubleshoot requests and corresponding responses. The value of this header is equal to the value of the `x-ms-client-request-id` header if it is present in the request and the value is at most 1024 visible ASCII characters. If the `x-ms-client-request-id` header is not present in the request, this header will not be present in the response.|
  
### Response body
None.  
  
## Authorization
Only the account owner may call this operation.  
  
## Remarks
When you abort a pending **Copy File** operation, the destination file's `x-ms-copy-status` header is set to `aborted`. Aborting a copy operation results in a destination file of zero length. However, the metadata for the destination file will have the new values copied from the source blob or file or set explicitly in the **Copy File** operation call.  
  
You can only abort a copy operation that is pending. Trying to abort a copy that has completed or failed results in **409 Conflict**. Trying to abort a copy operation using an incorrect copy ID also results in **409 Conflict**.
