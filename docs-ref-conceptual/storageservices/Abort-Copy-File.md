## Request  
 The Abort Copy File request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended.  
  
 Beginning with version 2013-08-15, you may specify a shared access signature for the destination file if it is in the same account as the source file. Beginning with version 2015-04-05, you may also specify a shared access signature for the destination file if it is in a different storage account.

|Myfile|The name of the file.|  
  
 For details on path naming restrictions, see [Naming and Referencing Shares, Directories, Files, and Metadata](Naming-and-Referencing-Shares--Directories--Files--and-Metadata.md).  
  
### URI Parameters

|Date or x-ms-date|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|x-ms-version|Required for all authorized requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. This operation is available only in versions 2015-02-21 and later.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](versioning-for-the-azure-storage-services.md).|  
|x-ms-copy-action:abort|Required.|  
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
## Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 204 (No Content).  
  
 For information about status codes, see Status and Error Codes.  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response also includes additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification.  
  
|Response header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|x-ms-request-id|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see Troubleshooting API Operations.|  
|x-ms-version|Indicates the version of the File service used to execute the request.|  
|Date|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
  
### Response Body  
 None.  
  
## Authorization  
 Only the account owner may call this operation.  
  
## Remarks  
 When you abort a pending **Copy File** operation, the destination fileâ€™s `x-ms-copy-status` header is set to `aborted`. Aborting a copy operation results in a destination file of zero length. However, the metadata for the destination file will have the new values copied from the source blob or file or set explicitly in the **Copy File** operation call.  
  
 You can only abort a copy operation that is pending. Trying to abort a copy that has completed or failed results in **409 Conflict**. Trying to abort a copy operation using an incorrect copy ID also results in **409 Conflict**.
