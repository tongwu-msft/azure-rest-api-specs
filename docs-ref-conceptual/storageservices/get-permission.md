# Get Permission

The `Get Permission` operation gets the [Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-definition-language) for a given security descriptor. This API is available starting in version 2019-02-02.
  
## Request  
The `Get Permission` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended.  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`GET`|`https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myshare?restype=share&comp=filepermission`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
Replace the path components shown in the request URI with your own, as follows:  
  
|Path Component|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|*myaccount*|The name of your storage account.|  
|*myshare*|The name of your file share. Note that it may include only lower-case characters.|  
  
For details on path naming restrictions, see [Naming and Referencing Shares, Directories, Files, and Metadata](Naming-and-Referencing-Shares--Directories--Files--and-Metadata.md).  
  
### URI Parameters  
The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Queue Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Queue-Service-Operations.md).|  

### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
| `Authorization` | Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, storage account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md)
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Optional. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
| `x-ms-file-permission-key` | Required. Security descriptor of the permission. |
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KiB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [Monitoring Azure Blob storage](/azure/storage/blobs/monitor-blob-storage).| 
  
### Request Body  
None.
  
## Response

| `x-ms-version` | Indicates the version of the File service used to execute the request. |
| `Date` or `x-ms-date` | A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated. |

If the `x-ms-client-request-id` header is not present in the request, this header will not be present in the response.|
