# List Shares
The `List Shares` operation returns a list of the shares and share snapshots under the specified account.  
  
## Request  
The `List Shares` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended.  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`GET`|`https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/?comp=list`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
Replace the path components shown in the request URI with your own, as follows:  
  
|Path Component|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|*myaccount*|The name of your storage account.|  
  
For details on path naming restrictions, see [Naming and Referencing Shares, Directories, Files, and Metadata](Naming-and-Referencing-Shares--Directories--Files--and-Metadata.md).  
  
### URI parameters  
The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`prefix`|Optional. Filters the results to return only shares whose name begins with the specified prefix.|  
|`marker`|Optional. A string value that identifies the portion of the list to be returned with the next list operation. The operation returns a marker value within the response body if the list returned was not complete. The marker value may then be used in a subsequent call to request the next set of list items.<br /><br /> The marker value is opaque to the client.|  
|`maxresults`|Optional. Specifies the maximum number of shares to return. If the request does not specify `maxresults`, or specifies a value greater than 5,000, the server will return up to 5,000 items. If the parameter is set to a value less than or equal to zero, the server will return status code 400 (Bad Request).|  
|`include=metadata,snapshots,deleted`|Optional. Specifies one or more datasets to include in the response:<br /><br /> -   `snapshots`: Version 2017-04-17 and newer. Specifies that share snapshots should be included in the response. Share Snapshots are listed from oldest to newest in the response.<br />-   `metadata`: Specifies that share metadata should be returned in the response.<br /> -   `deleted`: Specifies that deleted file shares should be included in the response.<br /><br /> To specify more than one of these options on the URI, you must separate each option with a URL-encoded comma ("%82").<br /><br /> All metadata names must adhere to the naming conventions for [C# identifiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference).|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The timeout parameter is expressed in seconds.  For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for File Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-File-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request headers  
The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authorized requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
  
### Request body  
None.  
  
## Response  
The response includes an HTTP status code, a set of response headers, and a response body in XML format.  
  
### Status code  
A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response headers

```  

- The `EnabledProtocols` element appears in the response body only in versions 2020-02-10 and later. 
- The `RootSquash` element appears in the response body only in versions 2020-02-10 and later when the enabled protocols contain NFS.
- The `Quota` element appears in the response body only in versions 2015-02-21 and later.  
- The `Version`, `Deleted`, `DeletedTime` and `RemainingRetentionDays` elements appears in the response body only in versions 2019-12-12 and later.  
- The `Prefix`, `Marker`, and `MaxResults` elements are only present if they were specified on the URI. The `NextMarker` element has a value only if the list results are not complete.  
- The `Metadata` element is present only if the `include=metadata` parameter was specified on the URI. Within the `Metadata` element, the value of each name-value pair is listed within an element corresponding to the pair's name.  
- The `Snapshots` are included in the response only if the`include=snapshots` parameter was specified with the include parameter on the request URI.
- The `AccessTier` element holds the tier of the share. If the share's tier has not been changed, this property will be the default tier `TransactionOptimized` on general purpose version 2 (GPv2) storage accounts and `Premium` on FileStorage storage accounts. Note that FileStorage storage accounts only support the `Premium` tier.
- The `AccessTierChangeTime` element is present only if the access tier on the share is explicitly set.
- The `AccessTierTransitionState` element is present only if the share is transitioning from one tier to another. It indicates the tier it is transitioning from.

### Sample response  
See the [Sample Request and Response](#sample-request-and-response) section later in this topic.  
  
## Authorization  
Only the account owner may call this operation.  
  
## Remarks  
If you specify a value for the `maxresults` parameter and the number of shares to return exceeds this value, or exceeds the default value for `maxresults`, the response body will contain a `NextMarker` element that indicates the next share to return on a subsequent request. To return the next set of items, specify the value of `NextMarker` as the marker parameter on the URI for the subsequent request.  
  
Note that the value of `NextMarker` should be treated as opaque.  
  
Shares are listed in alphabetical order in the response body.  
  
The `List Shares` operation times out after 30 seconds.  
  
## Sample request and response  
The following sample URI requests the list of shares for an account, setting the maximum results to return for the initial operation to 3.  
  
```  
GET https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/?comp=list&maxresults=3&include=snapshots HTTP/1.1  
```  
  
The request is sent with these headers:  
  
```  
x-ms-version: 2020-02-10  
x-ms-date: <date>  
Authorization: SharedKey myaccount:CY1OP3O3jGFpYFbTCBimLn0Xov0vt0khH/D5Gy0fXvg=  
```  
  
The status code and response headers are returned as follows:  
  
```  
HTTP/1.1 200 OK  
Transfer-Encoding: chunked  
Content-Type: application/xml  
Date: <date>  
x-ms-version: 2020-02-10  
Server: Windows-Azure-File/1.0 Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0  
```  
  
The response XML for this request is as follows. Note that the `NextMarker` element follows the set of shares and includes the name of the next share to be returned.  
  
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

        <AccessTier>Premium</AccessTier>
        <EnabledProtocols>NFS</EnabledProtocols>
        <RootSquash>RootSquash</RootSquash>
      </Properties>
    </Share>
    <Share>

      </Properties>  
    </Share>
  </Shares>  
  <NextMarker>video</NextMarker>  
</EnumerationResults>  
```  
  
The subsequent list operation specifies the marker on the request URI, as follows. The next set of results is returned beginning with the share specified by the marker.  
  
```  
https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/?comp=list&maxresults=3&marker=video  
```
