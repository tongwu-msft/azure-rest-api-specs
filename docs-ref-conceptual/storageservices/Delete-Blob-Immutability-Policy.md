# Set Blob Immutability Policy

The `Delete Blob Immutability Policy` operation deletes the immutability policy on a blob. This operation does not update the blob's ETag.  This API is available starting in version `2020-06-12`.

## Request
The `Delete Blob Immutability Policy` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace myaccount with the name of your storage account and myblob with the blob name for which the immutability policy will be deleted.

|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|
|------------|-----------------|------------------|
|`DELETE`|`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=immutabilityPolicies`|HTTP/1.1| 

### URI Parameters
The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.

|Parameter|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|`snapshot`|Optional. The snapshot parameter is an opaque `DateTime` value that, when present, specifies the blob snapshot to set tier on. For more information on working with blob snapshots, see [Creating a Snapshot of a Blob](Creating-a-Snapshot-of-a-Blob.md)|  
|`versionid`|Optional for versions 2019-12-12 and newer. The versionid parameter is an opaque `DateTime` value that, when present, specifies the version of the blob to set tier on.| 
|`timeout`|Optional. The timeout parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Blob Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).|

### Request Headers
The following table describes required and optional request headers.

|Request Header|Description|
|------------|-----------------|
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authorization scheme, storage account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authorize requests to Azure Storage](authorize-requests-to-azure-storage.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authorized requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1-kB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see see [About Storage Analytics Logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure Logging: Using Logs to Track Storage Requests](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|  

 This operation also supports the use of conditional headers to set the blob only if a specified condition is met. For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](Specifying-Conditional-Headers-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).  

### Request Body
None.

## Response
The response includes an HTTP status code and a set of response headers.

### Status Code
A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).

If the `x-ms-client-request-id` header is not present in the request, this header will not be present in the response.|
