# Version 2019-12-12
  
The 2019-12-12 service version includes the following features:

- A new pair of APIs [Get Blob Tags](get-blob-tags.md) and [Set Blob Tags](set-blob-tags.md) allow user-defined tags to be added to a blob which then act as a secondary index.
- A new API [Find Blobs by Tags](find-blobs-by-tags.md) allow blobs to be retrieved based upon their tags. 
- A new API [Query Blob Contents](query-blob-contents.md) applies a simple Structured Query Language (SQL) statement on a blob's contents and returns only the queried subset of the data.
- A new API [Restore Container](restore-container.md) to support soft deletion of containers.
- The [Set Blob Tier](set-blob-tier.md) API can now be called on snapshots. 
- The maximum size of a block uploaded via [Put Block](Put-Block.md) has been increased to 4 GiB (4000 MiB). This means that the maximum size of a block blob is now approximately 200 TiB.
- The maximum size for a blob uploaded through [Put Blob](Put-Blob.md) has been increased to 5 GiB (5000 MiB).
- Static Website Settings now support an absolute path for the index document.
- Blob and Queue anonymous and OAuth requests will return 401 (Unauthorized) with identity provider and resource information in order to support Bearer Challenge. 
- Blob APIs now support the Blob Versioning feature, which provides a fixed way to access a blob in subsequent requests.
