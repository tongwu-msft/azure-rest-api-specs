# Version 2018-03-28

The 2018-03-28 service version includes the following features.

- A static website may be configured using the [Set Blob Service Properties](Set-Blob-Service-Properties.md) API. The website is based on data in the `$web` container of a storage account. The website is accessible using a new endpoint, which is visible in the portal.
- A new API [Put Block from URL](put-block-from-url.md) allow blocks in a block blob to be staged using a range of another blob as a source. This permits synchronous server-side copies to be orchestrated for block blobs of any size.
- A new API [Get Account Information](get-account-information.md) returns the storage account SKU and kind.
