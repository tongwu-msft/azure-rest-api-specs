# List Containers
The `List Containers` operation returns a list of the containers under the specified account.  
  
##  <a name="Request"></a> Request  
 The `List Containers` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is recommended. Replace *myaccount* with the name of your storage account:  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`GET`|`https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/?comp=list`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
 Note that the URI must always include the forward slash (/) to separate the host name from the path and query portions of the URI. In the case of the `List Containers` operation, the path portion of the URI is empty.  
  
### Emulated Storage Service Request  
 When making a request against the emulated storage service, specify the emulator hostname and Blob service port as `127.0.0.1:10000`, followed by the emulated storage account name:  
  
|Method|Request URI|HTTP Version|  
|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
|`GET`|`http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1?comp=list`|HTTP/1.1|  
  
 Note that emulated storage only supports blob sizes up to 2 GB.  
  
 For more information, see [Using the Azure Storage Emulator for Development and Testing](/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator) and [Differences Between the Storage Emulator and Azure Storage Services](/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator#differences-between-the-storage-emulator-and-azure-storage).  
  
### URI Parameters  
 The following additional parameters may be specified on the request URI.  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`prefix`|Optional. Filters the results to return only containers whose name begins with the specified prefix.|  
|`marker`|Optional. A string value that identifies the portion of the list of containers to be returned with the next listing operation. The operation returns the `NextMarker` value within the response body if the listing operation did not return all containers remaining to be listed with the current page. The `NextMarker` value can be used as the value for the `marker` parameter in a subsequent call to request the next page of list items.<br /><br /> The marker value is opaque to the client.|  
|`maxresults`|Optional. Specifies the maximum number of containers to return. If the request does not specify `maxresults`, or specifies a value greater than 5000, the server will return up to 5000 items. <br /><br />Note that if the listing operation crosses a partition boundary, then the service will return a continuation token for retrieving the remainder of the results. For this reason, it is possible that the service will return fewer results than specified by `maxresults`, or than the default of 5000. <br /><br />If the parameter is set to a value less than or equal to zero, the server returns status code 400 (Bad Request).|  
|`include=metadata`|Optional. Include this parameter to specify that the container's metadata be returned as part of the response body.<br /><br /> Note that metadata requested with this parameter must be stored in accordance with the naming restrictions imposed by the 2009-09-19 version of the Blob service. Beginning with this version, all metadata names must adhere to the naming conventions for [C# identifiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference).|  
|`timeout`|Optional. The `timeout` parameter is expressed in seconds. For more information, see [Setting Timeouts for Blob Service Operations](Setting-Timeouts-for-Blob-Service-Operations.md).|  
  
### Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Authorization`|Required. Specifies the authentication scheme, account name, and signature. For more information, see [Authentication for the Azure Storage Services](authorization-for-the-azure-storage-services.md).|  
|`Date` or `x-ms-date`|Required. Specifies the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the request. For more information, see [Authentication for the Azure Storage Services](authorization-for-the-azure-storage-services.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Required for all authenticated requests. Specifies the version of the operation to use for this request. For more information, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](Versioning-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services.md).|  
|`x-ms-client-request-id`|Optional. Provides a client-generated, opaque value with a 1 KB character limit that is recorded in the analytics logs when storage analytics logging is enabled. Using this header is highly recommended for correlating client-side activities with requests received by the server. For more information, see [About Storage Analytics Logging](About-Storage-Analytics-Logging.md) and [Azure Logging: Using Logs to Track Storage Requests](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/08/03/windows-azure-storage-logging-using-logs-to-track-storage-requests.aspx).|  
  
### Request Body  
 None.  
  
##  <a name="Response"></a> Response  
 The response includes an HTTP status code, a set of response headers, and a response body in XML format.  
  
### Status Code  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK).  
  
 For information about status codes, see [Status and Error Codes](Status-and-Error-Codes2.md).  
  
### Response Headers  
 The response for this operation includes the following headers. The response also includes additional standard HTTP headers. All standard headers conform to the [HTTP/1.1 protocol specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=150478).  
  
|Response header|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------------|  
|`Content-Type`|Standard HTTP/1.1 header. Specifies the format in which the results are returned. Currently, this value is application/xml.|  
|`x-ms-request-id`|This header uniquely identifies the request that was made and can be used for troubleshooting the request. For more information, see [Troubleshooting API Operations](Troubleshooting-API-Operations.md).|  
|`x-ms-version`|Indicates the version of the Blob service used to execute the request. This header is returned for requests made against version 2009-09-19 and above.|  
|`Date`|A UTC date/time value generated by the service that indicates the time at which the response was initiated.|  
  
### Response Body  
 The format of the response body is as follows.  
  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<EnumerationResults ServiceEndpoint="https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net">  
  <Prefix>string-value</Prefix>  
  <Marker>string-value</Marker>  
  <MaxResults>int-value</MaxResults>  
  <Containers>  
    <Container>  
      <Name>container-name</Name>  
      <Properties>  
        <Last-Modified>date/time-value</Last-Modified>  
        <Etag>etag</Etag>  
        <LeaseStatus>locked | unlocked</LeaseStatus>  
        <LeaseState>available | leased | expired | breaking | broken</LeaseState>  
        <LeaseDuration>infinite | fixed</LeaseDuration> 
        <PublicAccess>container | blob</PublicAccess>
        <HasImmutabilityPolicy>true | false</HasImmutabilityPolicy>
        <HasLegalHold>true | false</HasLegalHold>
      </Properties>  
      <Metadata>  
        <metadata-name>value</metadata-name>  
      </Metadata>  
    </Container>  
  </Containers>  
  <NextMarker>marker-value</NextMarker>  
</EnumerationResults>  
```  
  
 `LeaseStatus`, `LeaseState`, and `LeaseDuration` only appear in version 2012-02-12 and later.  
  
 Beginning with version 2013-08-15, the `AccountName` attribute for the `EnumerationResults` element has been renamed to `ServiceEndpoint`. The `URL` element has also been removed from the `Container` element. For versions prior to 2013-08-15, the container's URL, as specified by the `URL` field, does not include the `restype=container` parameter. If you use this value to make subsequent requests against the enumerated containers, be sure to append this parameter to indicate that the resource type is a container.  
  
 The `Prefix`, `Marker`, and `MaxResults` elements are only present if they were specified on the URI. The `NextMarker` element has a value only if the list results are not complete.  
  
 The `Metadata` element is present only if the `include=metadata` parameter was specified on the URI. Within the `Metadata` element, the value of each name-value pair is listed within an element corresponding to the pair's name.  
  
 If a metadata name-value pair violates the naming restrictions enforced by the 2009-09-19 version, the response body indicates the problematic name within an `x-ms-invalid-name` element, as shown in the following XML fragment:  
  
```  
  
<Metadata>  
  <MyMetadata1>first value</MyMetadata1>  
  <MyMetadata2>second value</MyMetadata2>  
  <x-ms-invalid-name>invalid-metadata-name</x-ms-invalid-name>  
</Metadata>  
  
```  

Beginning with the 2016-05-31 version, the container public permissions will be provided in the PublicAccess property. It indicates whether data in the container may be accessed publicly and the level of access. Possible values include:
- container: Indicates full public read access for container and blob data. Clients can enumerate blobs within the container via anonymous request, but cannot enumerate containers within the storage account.
- blob: Indicates public read access for blobs. Blob data within this container can be read via anonymous request, but container data is not available. Clients cannot enumerate blobs within the container via anonymous request.

If this property is not specified in the <properties> section, the container is private to the account owner.

`HasImmutabilityPolicy` and `HasLegalHold` only appear in version 2017-11-09 and later. 
`HasImmutabilityPolicy` is `true` if the container has an immutability policy set on it, `false` otherwise.
`HasLegalHold` is `true` if the container has one or more legal hold(s) on it, `false` otherwise.

> [!NOTE]
>  Beginning with version 2009-09-19, the response body for `List Containers` returns the container's last modified time in an element named `Last-Modified`. In previous versions, this element was named `LastModified`.  
  
##  <a name="Authorization"></a> Authorization  
 Only the account owner may call this operation.  
  
## Remarks  
 If you specify a value for the `maxresults` parameter and the number of containers to return exceeds this value, or exceeds the default value for `maxresults`, the response body will contain the `NextMarker` element (also referred to as a continuation token). `NextMarker` indicates the next container to return on a subsequent request. To return the next set of items, specify the value of `NextMarker` for the `marker` parameter on the URI for the subsequent request. Note that the value of `NextMarker` should be treated as opaque.

If the listing operation crosses a partition boundary, then the service will return a value for the `NextMarker` element for retrieving the remainder of the results from the next partition. A listing operation that spans more than one partition results in a smaller set of items being returned than is specified by `maxresults`, or than the default of 5000. Your application should always check for the presence of the `NextMarker` element when you perform a listing operation, and handle it accordingly.   
  
 Containers are listed in alphabetical order in the response body.  
  
 The `List Containers` operation times out after 30 seconds.  
  
##  <a name="Samplerequestandresponse"></a> Sample Request and Response  
 The following sample URI requests the list of containers for an account, setting the maximum results to return for the initial operation to 3.  
  
```  
GET https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/?comp=list&maxresults=3 HTTP/1.1  
```  
  
 The request is sent with these headers:  
  
```  
x-ms-version: 2016-05-31  
x-ms-date: Wed, 26 Oct 2016 22:08:44 GMT  
Authorization: SharedKey myaccount:CY1OP3O3jGFpYFbTCBimLn0Xov0vt0khH/D5Gy0fXvg=  
```  
  
 The status code and response headers are returned as follows:  
  
```  
HTTP/1.1 200 OK  
Transfer-Encoding: chunked  
Content-Type: application/xml  
Date: Wed, 26 Oct 2016 22:08:54 GMT  
x-ms-version: 2016-05-31  
Server: Windows-Azure-Blob/1.0 Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0  
  
```  
  
 The response XML for this request is as follows. Note that the `NextMarker` element follows the set of containers and includes the name of the next container to be returned.  
  
```  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<EnumerationResults ServiceEndpoint="https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/">  
  <MaxResults>3</MaxResults>  
  <Containers>  
    <Container>  
      <Name>audio</Name>  
      <Properties>  
        <Last-Modified>Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:39:39 GMT</Last-Modified>  
        <Etag>0x8CACB9BD7C6B1B2</Etag> 
        <PublicAccess>container</PublicAccess> 
      </Properties>  
    </Container>  
    <Container>  
      <Name>images</Name>  
      <Properties>  
        <Last-Modified>Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:39:39 GMT</Last-Modified>  
        <Etag>0x8CACB9BD7C1EEEC</Etag>  
      </Properties>  
    </Container>  
    <Container>  
      <Name>textfiles</Name>  
      <Properties>  
        <Last-Modified>Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:39:39 GMT</Last-Modified>  
        <Etag>0x8CACB9BD7BACAC3</Etag>  
      </Properties>  
    </Container>  
  </Containers>  
  <NextMarker>video</NextMarker>  
</EnumerationResults>  
```  
  
 The subsequent list operation specifies the marker on the request URI, as follows. The next set of results is returned beginning with the container specified by the marker.  
  
```  
https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/?comp=list&maxresults=3&marker=video  
```
