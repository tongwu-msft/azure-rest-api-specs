# Version 2019-07-07
  
The 2019-07-07 service version includes the following features:

- The [Copy File](Copy-File.md) API includes a series of new headers which control the copy behavior of SMB properties such as File Attributes. 
- The [Get Share Properties](Get-Share-Properties.md) API now returns properties for premium file shares that relate to the provisioned limits for the share.
- The [Force Close Handles](force-close-handles.md) API includes a new header to indicate the number of handles that failed to close.
