# Storage Analytics
Azure Storage Analytics performs logging and provides metrics data for a storage account. You can use this data to trace requests, analyze usage trends, and diagnose issues with your storage account.  

 Storage Analytics metrics are enabled by default for new storage accounts. You can enable logging and configure both metrics and logging in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/); for details, see [Monitor a storage account in the Azure portal](/azure/storage/storage-monitor-storage-account). You can also enable Storage Analytics programmatically via the REST API or the client library. Use the `Set Service Properties` operation to enable Storage Analytics individually for each service.  

> [!NOTE]
>  Storage Analytics metrics are available for the Blob, Queue, Table, and File services.  
>   
>  Storage Analytics logging is available for the Blob, Queue, and Table services. However, premium storage account is not supported.
>   
>  Storage accounts with a replication type of Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS) do not have the metrics or logging capability enabled at this time.  

 The aggregated data is stored in a well-known blob (for logging) and in well-known tables (for metrics), which may be accessed using the Blob service and Table service APIs.  

 Storage Analytics has a 20TB limit on the amount of stored data that is independent of the total limit for your storage account. For more information on billing and data retention policies, see [Storage Analytics and Billing](Storage-Analytics-and-Billing.md). For more information on storage account limits, see [Azure Storage Scalability and Performance Targets](/azure/storage/storage-scalability-targets).  

 For an in-depth guide on using Storage Analytics and other tools to identify, diagnose, and troubleshoot Azure Storage-related issues, see [Monitor, diagnose, and troubleshoot Microsoft Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting/).
