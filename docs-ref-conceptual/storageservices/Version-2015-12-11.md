# Version 2015-12-11

- The [Put Blob](Put-Blob.md), [Put Block](Put-Block.md), [Put Block List](Put-Block-List.md), [Put Page](Put-Page.md), [Append Block](Append-Block.md), and [Set Blob Metadata](Set-Blob-Metadata.md) operations now return the x-ms-request-server-encrypted response header. This header is set to true if the contents of the request have been successfully encrypted.
- The [Get Blob](Get-Blob.md) and [Get Blob Properties](Get-Blob-Properties.md) operations now return the x-ms-server-encrypted response header. This header is set to true if the blob data and application metadata are completely encrypted. If the blob is not encrypted, or if only parts of the blob/application metadata are encrypted, this header is set to false.
- Beginning with version 2015-12-11, the Atom feed is no longer supported as a payload format for Table service operations. Version 2015-12-11 and later versions support only JSON for the payload format.
