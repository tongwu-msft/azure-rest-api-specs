# Azure Billing REST API

The Azure Billing APIs allow you to view and manage your billing details programmatically. Operation groups listed below do not support all billing accounts. Supported billing accounts are specified in the table. To identify your billing account type, see [Billing accounts and scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/view-all-accounts).
