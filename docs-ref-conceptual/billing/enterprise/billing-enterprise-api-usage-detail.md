# Reporting APIs for Enterprise customers - Usage Details

The Usage Detail API offers a daily breakdown of consumed quantities and estimated charges by an Enrollment. The result also includes information on instances, meters, and departments. The API can be queried by Billing period or by a specified start and end date. 

Common header properties that need to be added are specified [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-enterprise-api). Custom time ranges can be specified with the start and end date parameters that are in the format yyyy-MM-dd.  

## CSV Format (currently in preview)
The API listed below provides data in csv format.

### Synchronous call (non-polling)
We return data in csv format as a response of the rest API call. The API performance is dependent on the amount of usage data returned by your call. Even though the API supports custom date ranges we recommend that you restrict it based on the volume of usage data you have for that period.  We allow maximum of one month support.

|Method | Download Request URI|
|-|-|
|GET|https://consumption.azure.com/v2/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/usagedetails/download?billingPeriod={billingPeriod}
|GET|https://consumption.azure.com/v2/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/usagedetails/download?startTime=2017-01-01&endTime=2017-01-10|

### Asynchronous call (polling based)
This is a two-step process that requires you to submit your request first for a specific time range and then poll to get a shared access key based URL for an Azure Blob location which has csv data. The maximum supported time rang here is 36 months. We recommend this API for larger datasets

|Method | Submit Request URI|
|-|-|
|POST|https://consumption.azure.com/v2/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/usagedetails/submit?billingPeriod={billingPeriod}
|POST|https://consumption.azure.com/v2/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/usagedetails/submit?startTime=2017-04-01&endTime=2017-04-10|

#### Response of Asynchronous (polling) submit call

	{
		"id": "string",
		"enrollmentNumber":"string",
		"requestedOn":"2017-08-29T06:56:29.1290704Z",
		"status":1,
		"blobPath":"",
		"reportUrl":"string",
		"startDate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00",
		"endDate":"2017-06-30T00:00:00"
	}


##### Asynchronous call Response property definitions

|Property Name| Type| Description
|-|-|-|
|id| string| The unique Id for this request. |
|enrollmentNumber| string| The Enrollment number the request was made for.|
|requestedOn| string| The date time that request was made on. |
|status| int| Indicates the status of the request. Queued = 1, InProgress = 2, Completed = 3, Failed = 4, NoDataFound = 5, ReadyToDownload=6, TimedOut = 7. |
|blobPath| string| The shared access key URL to the csv blob. |
|reportUrl| string| The URL that can be used to poll for the status of submit request. |
|startDate| string| Corresponds to the beginning of the time range used while making the submit call. |
|endDate| string| Corresponds to the end of the time range used while making the submit call.|

The reportUrl is the URL that can be used for further polling calls (GET operation). When the status field in the response of polling request comes back as 3, the request is completed. We have the blobPath field in the response populated with a URL pointing to the csv data. The blob is available for 1 hour from the date time in requestedOn field of response. Status 4, 5 and 7 are failure status where the API call has hit an error condition. For all other status, the polling call should be repeated. 

## JSON Format 
The API listed below provide data in JSON format. If a billing period is not specified, then data for the current billing period is returned. The maximum supported time range is 36 months. 

|Method | Request URI|
|-|-|
|GET|https://consumption.azure.com/v2/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/usagedetails 
|GET|https://consumption.azure.com/v2/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/billingPeriods/{billingPeriod}/usagedetails|
|GET|https://consumption.azure.com/v2/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/usagedetailsbycustomdate?startTime=2017-01-01&endTime=2017-01-10|

> [!Note]
> To use the preview version of API, replace v2 with v1 in the above URL.

### Response

> Due to the potentially large volume of data the result set is paged. The nextLink property, if present, specifies the link for the next page of data. If the link is empty, it denotes that is the last page.
