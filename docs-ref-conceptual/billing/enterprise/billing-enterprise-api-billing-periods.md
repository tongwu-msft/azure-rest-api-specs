# Reporting APIs for Enterprise customers - Billing Periods

The Billing Periods API returns a list of billing periods that have consumption data for the specified Enrollment in reverse chronological order. Each Period contains a property pointing to the API route for the four sets of data - BalanceSummary, UsageDetails, Marktplace Charges, and PriceSheet. If the period does not have data, the corresponding property is null.
