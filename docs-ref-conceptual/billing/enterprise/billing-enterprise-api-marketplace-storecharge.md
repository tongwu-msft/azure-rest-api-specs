# Reporting APIs for Enterprise customers - Marketplace Store Charge

> [!Note]
> Microsoft no longer updates the Enterprise Reporting APIs. Instead, you should use [Azure Consumption](/rest/api/consumption) APIs.
> The Azure Billing - Marketplace Charges API is replaced by the [Azure Consumption - Charges API](/rest/api/consumption/charges).

The Marketplace Store Charge API returns the usage-based marketplace charges breakdown by day for the specified Billing Period or start and end dates. Recurring Charges are returned as a part of the API response.

## Request
Common header properties that you must specify are shown in the [Reporting APIs for Enterprise customers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-enterprise-api) article. If a billing period isn't specified, then data for the current billing period is returned. You can specify custom time ranges. Start and end date parameters are in yyyy-MM-dd format. The maximum supported time range is 36 months.
