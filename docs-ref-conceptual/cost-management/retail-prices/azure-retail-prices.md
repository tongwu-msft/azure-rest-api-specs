# Azure retail prices overview

Many Azure customers have been looking for a programmatic way to retrieve Azure service retail prices. Previously, the only way that you could retrieve prices for Azure services was to either use the Azure Pricing Calculator or go to the Azure portal. This API gives you an unauthenticated way to get retail rates for all Azure services. Use the API to explore prices for Azure services against different regions and different SKUs. The programmatic API can also help you build your own tools for internal analysis and price comparison.

## API endpoint

https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices
