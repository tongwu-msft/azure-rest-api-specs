# Common Error Codes

When making requests against Azure Communication Services' REST API, you may come across error codes, which signal that an error has occurred. To help you with troubleshooting, a list of common error codes is provided below for various scenarios. For more information on troubleshooting these error codes, see our [TroubleShooting Guide](/azure/communication-services/concepts/troubleshooting-info).

## HTTP Status Codes

You'll receive standard [HTTP Status Codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html) in the service responses from Azure Communication Services. Some of these codes, may signify an error. To aid you in troubleshooting a description of common HTTP Status codes and what they mean within the context of Azure Communication Services is provided below:

| HTTP status code          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
