# Azure Communication Services

Azure Communication Services allows you to easily add real-time multimedia voice, video, and telephony-over-IP communications features to your applications. The Communication Services client libraries also allow you to add chat and SMS functionality to your communications solutions.

The Azure Communication Services REST API provides programmatic access to resources and items within Communication Services.

## Communication Services Resource Groups

TODO: Chat has no Overview page, due to its multi-folder listings, how can we make it have one?
You can perform various actions against several key areas of communication services:

| Resource Groups                                                                       | Description                                                                                            |
