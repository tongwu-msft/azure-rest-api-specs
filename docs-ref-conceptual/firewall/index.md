# Azure Firewall REST API

Azure Firewall is a managed cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It is a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. Customers can centrally create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual networks. Azure Firewall provides a static public IP address for your virtual network resources allowing outside firewalls to identify traffic originating from your virtual network.  The service is fully integrated with Azure Monitor for logging and analytics. For a more detailed overview see the [Azure AzureFirewall product page](https://aka.ms/azurefw).
