# Get Media Services Account Details
> [!NOTE]
>  It is now recommended to use  the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) REST API endpoints, as described in [Media Services Management API Reference](../api/media/mediaservice).  
  
 The `GET` request method described in this topic returns an `AccountDetails` object for the specified Media Services account. The data contract for `AccountDetails` is defined later in this topic.  
  
 The request may be specified as follows (replace `<subscription-id>` with your subscription ID, and `<accountName>` with your account name):  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Method|Request URI|  
|GET|https://endpoint/\<subscriptionId>/services/mediaservices/Accounts/\<accountName>|  
  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK). For information about error codes, see [Media Services Management Error Codes](../operations/media-services-management-error-codes.md).  
  
## Data Contract  
 The data contract for `AccountDetails` is defined as follows:  
  
```  
[DataContract]   
public class AccountDetails   
{   
    public AccountDetails();   
  
    [DataMember]   
    public string AccountKey { get; set; }   
  
    [DataMember]   
    public AccountKeys AccountKeys { get; set; }   
  
    [DataMember]   
    public string AccountName { get; set; }   
  
    [DataMember]   
    public string AccountRegion { get; set; }   
  
    [DataMember]   
    public string StorageAccountName { get; set; } }  
  
```
