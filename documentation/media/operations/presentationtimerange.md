# PresentationTimeRange
`PresentationTimeRange` is used by manifest filters ([AssetFilter](../services/assetfilter.md)s and global [Filter](../services/filter.md)s). The `PresentationTimeRange` rule group is used for filtering manifest start/end points, presentation window length, and the live start position. Media Services uses intersections of multiple ranges to define the final presentation window.  
  
 For a detailed overview and code samples of dynamically generated manifests, see [Dynamic manifests overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/media-services-dynamic-manifest-overview/).  
  
 Also, see [Filter](../services/filter.md) and [AssetFilter](../services/assetfilter.md).  
  
 This topic describes the `PresentationTimeRange` entity.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  When working with the Media Services REST API, the following considerations apply:  
>   
>  -   When accessing entities in Media Services, you must set specific header fields and values in your HTTP requests. For more information, see [Setup for Media Services REST API Development](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/42ae6204-93bc-4797-bf40-1c68512cfb73).  
> -   After successfully connecting to https://media.windows.net, you will receive a 301 redirect specifying another Media Services URI. You must make subsequent calls to the new URI.

## PresentationTimeRange properties  
  
|Property|Type|Description|  
|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|`StartTimestamp`<br /><br /> Applies to VoD or Live streams.|Edm.Int64|The value represents an absolute start point of the stream. The value gets rounded to the closest next GOP start.<br /><br /> Use StartTimestamp and EndTimestamp to trim the playlist (manifest).  For example, StartTimestamp=40000000 and EndTimestamp = 100000000 will generate a playlist that contains media between StartTimestamp and EndTimestamp. If a fragment straddles the boundary, the entire fragment will be included in the manifest.|  
|`EndTimestamp`<br /><br /> Applies to VoD. For the Live presentation, it is silently ignored and applied when the presentation ends and the stream becomes VoD.|Edm.Int64|The value represents an absolute end point of the stream. It gets rounded to the closest next GOP start.<br /><br /> Use StartTimestamp and EndTimestamp to trim the playlist (manifest).  For example, StartTimestamp=40000000 and EndTimestamp = 100000000 will generate a playlist that contains media between StartTimestamp and EndTimestamp. If a fragment straddles the boundary, the entire fragment will be included in the manifest.|  
|`PresentationWindowDuration`<br /><br /> Applies to Live and VoD. For VoD, it is used to enable smooth transitions when the Live presentation ends.|Edm.Int64|Use PresentationWindowDuration to apply a sliding window to the playlist.  For example, set PresentationWindowDuration=1200000000 to apply a two minute sliding window.  Media within 2 minutes of the live edge will be included in the playlist.  If a fragment straddles the boundary, the entire fragment will be included in the playlist<br /><br /> The minimum presentation window duration is 120 seconds.|  
|`LiveBackoffDuration`<br /><br /> Applies to Live only. For VoD, it is silently ignored to enable smooth transitions when the presentation ends|Edm.Int64|Used to define live playback position. Using this rule, you can delay live playback position and create a server side buffer for players. LiveBackoffDuration is relative to the live position.<br /><br /> The maximum live backoff duration is 60 seconds.|  
|`Timescale`<br /><br /> Applies to VoD or Live streams.|Edm.Int64|The timescale used by the timestamps and durations specified above.  The default timescale is 10000000. An alternative timescale can be used.<br /><br /> Default is 10000000 HNS (hundred nanosecond).|
