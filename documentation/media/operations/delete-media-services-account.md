# Delete Media Services Account
> [!NOTE]
>  It is now recommended to use  the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) REST API endpoints, as described [Media Services Management API Reference](../Topic/Media%20Services%20Management%20API%20Reference.md).  
  
 The `DELETE` request method described in this topic deletes the specified Media Services account in the specified subscription.

|||  
|-|-|  
|Method|Request URI|  
|DELETE|https://endpoint/\<subscriptionId>/services/mediaservices/Accounts/\<accountName>|  
  
 A successful operation returns status code 200 (OK). For information about error codes, see [Media Services Management Error Codes](../MediaServicesOperations_RESTAPI/media-services-management-error-codes.md).
