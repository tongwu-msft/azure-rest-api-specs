# Attach Storage Account
> [!NOTE]
>  It is now recommended to use  the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) REST API endpoints, as described in [Media Services Management API Reference](../api/media/mediaservice).  
  
 The `POST` request method described in this topic attaches a storage account to the specified Media Services account. The data contract for `AttachStorageAccount` is defined later in this topic.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  Currently, once a storage account is attached to the specified Media Services account, it cannot be detached.  
  
 The request may be specified as follows (replace `<subscription-id>` with your subscription ID, and `<accountName>` with your account name.):  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Method|Request URI|  
|POST|https://endpoint/\<subscriptionId>/services/mediaservices/Accounts/\<accountName>/StorageAccounts|  
  
 A successful operation returns status code 204 (NoContent). For information about error codes, see [Media Services Management Error Codes](../operations/media-services-management-error-codes.md).  
  
 When attaching multiple storage accounts to your Media Services account, the following considerations apply:  
  
-   All storage accounts attached to a Media Services account must be in the same data center as the Media Services account.  
  
-   Currently, once a storage account is attached to the specified Media Services account, it cannot be detached.  
  
-   Primary storage account is the one indicated during Media Services account creation time. Currently, you cannot change the default storage account.  
  
## Data Contract  
 The data contract for `AttachStorageAccountRequest` is defined as follows:  
  
```  
[DataContract]   
public class AttachStorageAccountRequest   
{   
  
    [DataMember]   
    public string StorageAccountKey { get; set; }   
  
    [DataMember]   
    public string StorageAccountName { get; set; }   
  
    [DataMember]   
    public string BlobStorageEndPointUri { get; set; }   
}  
  
```  
  
## Example  
 See the `AttachStorageAccountToMediaServiceAccount` method defined in [How to: Use Media Services Management REST API](../operations/how-to--use-media-services-management-rest-api.md).
