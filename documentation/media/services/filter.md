# Filter
`Filter`s are used to define filters for assets’ streaming manifests. Defined filters can be applied to any of the following streaming protocols: HLS, MPEG-DASH, Smooth Streaming, and HDS. Media Services dynamically generates manifests based on specified filters. Filters can be defined at a global level (`Filter`) or asset level ([AssetFilter](../services/assetfilter.md)). Use `Filter` to apply filters to any of your assets. Use `AssetFilter` to apply filters to a specific asset.  
  
 For a detailed overview and code samples of dynamically generated manifests, see [Dynamic manifests overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/media-services-dynamic-manifest-overview/).  
  
 This topic gives an overview of the `Filter` entity (used to define global filters) and also demonstrates how to execute various operations with the Media Services REST API.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  When working with the Media Services REST API, the following considerations apply:  
>   
>  -   When accessing entities in Media Services, you must set specific header fields and values in your HTTP requests. For more information, see [Setup for Media Services REST API Development](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/42ae6204-93bc-4797-bf40-1c68512cfb73).  
> -   After successfully connecting to https://media.windows.net, you will receive a 301 redirect specifying another Media Services URI. You must make subsequent calls to the new URI.

##  <a name="filter_properties"></a> Filter properties  
  
|Property|Type|Description|  
|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|`Name`|Edm.String|Friendly name of the filter.|  
|`PresentationTimeRange`|[PresentationTimeRange](../services/presentationtimerange.md)|The `PresentationTimeRange` rule group is used for filtering manifest start/end points, presentation window length, and the live start position.

##  <a name="update_a_filter"></a> Update a filter  
 Use PATCH, PUT or MERGE to update a Filter with new property values.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you update a filter, it can take up to 2 minutes for streaming endpoint to refresh the rules. If the content was served using this filter (and cached in proxies and CDN caches), updating this filter can result in player failures. It is recommend to clear the cache after updating the filter. If this option is not possible, consider using a different filter.
