# Operation
Represents the current state of a long-running operation. Examples of long-running operations include starting, stopping, and deleting an Origin.  
  
 This topic gives an overview of the `Operation` entity and also demonstrates how to execute various operations with the Media Services REST API.  
  
-   [Operation Entity Properties](#operation_properties)  
  
-   [Query Operations](#query_operations)  
  
-   [Operation Error Codes](#error_codes)  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  When working with the Media Services REST API, the following considerations apply:  
>   
>  -   When accessing entities in Media Services, you must set specific header fields and values in your HTTP requests. For more information, see [Setup for Media Services REST API Development](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/42ae6204-93bc-4797-bf40-1c68512cfb73).  
> -   After successfully connecting to https://media.windows.net, you will receive a 301 redirect specifying another Media Services URI. You must make subsequent calls to the new URI.
