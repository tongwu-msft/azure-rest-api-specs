### Response  
 Status code: 202  
  
 This is an asynchronous operation that returns a status of 202 until the job is successfully deleted. The **Location** response header contains the URI that is used to obtain the status of the process. While the process is running, a call to the URI in the **Location** header returns a status of 202. When the process finishes, the URI in the **Location** header returns a status of 200.
