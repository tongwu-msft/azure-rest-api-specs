  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview) Flows. When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0 or v2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) supports Work, School, and Guests but does not support Personal accounts."
