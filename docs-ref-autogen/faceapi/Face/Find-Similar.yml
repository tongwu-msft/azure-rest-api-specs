summary: >
  Given query face's faceId, to search the similar-looking faces from a faceId array, a face list or a large face list. faceId array contains the faces created by [Face - Detect With Url](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/detectwithurl) or [Face - Detect With Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/detectwithstream), which will expire at the time specified by faceIdTimeToLive after creation. A "faceListId" is created by [FaceList - Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/facelist/create) containing persistedFaceIds that will not expire. And a "largeFaceListId" is created by [LargeFaceList - Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largefacelist/create) containing persistedFaceIds that will also not expire. Depending on the input the returned similar faces list contains faceIds or persistedFaceIds ranked by similarity.

  <br/>Find similar has two working modes, "matchPerson" and "matchFace". "matchPerson" is the default mode that it tries to find faces of the same person as possible by using internal same-person thresholds. It is useful to find a known person's other photos. Note that an empty list will be returned if no faces pass the internal thresholds. "matchFace" mode ignores same-person thresholds and returns ranked similar faces anyway, even the similarity is low. It can be used in the cases like searching celebrity-looking faces.

  <br/>The 'recognitionModel' associated with the query face's faceId should be the same as the 'recognitionModel' used by the target faceId array, face list or large face list.
