  summary: >-
    Add a face to a person into a person group for face identification or verification. To deal with an image contains multiple faces, input face can be specified as an image with a targetFace rectangle. It returns a persistedFaceId representing the added face. No image will be stored. Only the extracted face feature will be stored on server until [PersonGroup PersonFace - Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/persongroupperson/deleteface), [PersonGroup Person - Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/persongroupperson/delete) or [PersonGroup - Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/persongroup/delete) is called.

    <br /> Note persistedFaceId is different from faceId generated by [Face - Detect](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/detectwithurl).

    *   Higher face image quality means better recognition precision. Please consider high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size is 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.

    *   Each person entry can hold up to 248 faces.

    *   JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported. The allowed image file size is from 1KB to 6MB.

    *   "targetFace" rectangle should contain one face. Zero or multiple faces will be regarded as an error. If the provided "targetFace" rectangle is not returned from [Face - Detect](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/detectwithurl), there’s no guarantee to detect and add the face successfully.

    *   Out of detectable face size (36x36 - 4096x4096 pixels), large head-pose, or large occlusions will cause failures.

    *   Adding/deleting faces to/from a same person will be processed sequentially. Adding/deleting faces to/from different persons are processed in parallel.

    * The minimum detectable face size is 36x36 pixels in an image no larger than 1920x1080 pixels. Images with dimensions higher than 1920x1080 pixels will need a proportionally larger minimum face size.

    * Different 'detectionModel' values can be provided. To use and compare different detection models, please refer to [How to specify a detection model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/face/face-api-how-to-topics/specify-detection-model).
