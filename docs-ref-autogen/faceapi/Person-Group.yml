  summary: >-
    Create a new person group with specified personGroupId, name, user-provided userData and recognitionModel.

    <br /> A person group is the container of the uploaded person data, including face recognition features.

    <br /> After creation, use [PersonGroup Person - Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/persongroupperson/create) to add persons into the group, and then call [PersonGroup - Train](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/persongroup/train) to get this group ready for [Face - Identify](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/identify).

    <br /> No image will be stored. Only the person's extracted face features and userData will be stored on server until [PersonGroup Person - Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/persongroupperson/delete) or [PersonGroup - Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/persongroup/delete) is called.

    <br/>'recognitionModel' should be specified to associate with this person group. The default value for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the latest model needed, please explicitly specify the model you need in this parameter. New faces that are added to an existing person group will use the recognition model that's already associated with the collection. Existing face features in a person group can't be updated to features extracted by another version of recognition model.


    Person group quota:

    * Free-tier subscription quota: 1,000 person groups. Each holds up to 1,000 persons.

    * S0-tier subscription quota: 1,000,000 person groups. Each holds up to 10,000 persons.

    * to handle larger scale face identification problem, please consider using [LargePersonGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largepersongroup).
- uid: faceapi.persongroup.delete
  summary: Delete an existing person group. Persisted face features of all people in the person group will also be deleted.
- uid: faceapi.persongroup.get
  summary: Retrieve person group name, userData and recognitionModel. To get person information under this personGroup, use [PersonGroup Person - List](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/persongroupperson/list).
- uid: faceapi.persongroup.gettrainingstatus
  summary: Retrieve the training status of a person group (completed or ongoing).
- uid: faceapi.persongroup.list
  summary: >
    List person groups’ personGroupId, name, userData and recognitionModel.<br />

    * Person groups are stored in alphabetical order of personGroupId.

    * "start" parameter (string, optional) is a user-provided personGroupId value that returned entries have larger ids by string comparison. "start" set to empty to indicate return from the first item.

    * "top" parameter (int, optional) specifies the number of entries to return. A maximal of 1000 entries can be returned in one call. To fetch more, you can specify "start" with the last returned entry’s Id of the current call.

    <br />

    For example, total 5 person groups: "group1", ..., "group5".

    <br /> "start=&top=" will return all 5 groups.

    <br /> "start=&top=2" will return "group1", "group2".

    <br /> "start=group2&top=3" will return "group3", "group4", "group5".
