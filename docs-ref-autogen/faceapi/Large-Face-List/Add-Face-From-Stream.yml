groupName: Large Face List
apiVersion: "1.0"
summary: >-
  Add a face to a specified large face list, up to 1,000,000 faces.

  <br /> To deal with an image contains multiple faces, input face can be specified as an image with a targetFace rectangle. It returns a persistedFaceId representing the added face. No image will be stored. Only the extracted face feature will be stored on server until [LargeFaceList Face - Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largefacelist/deleteface) or [LargeFaceList - Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largefacelist/delete) is called.

  <br /> Note persistedFaceId is different from faceId generated by [Face - Detect](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/detectwithurl).

  * Higher face image quality means better recognition precision. Please consider high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size is 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.

  * JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported. The allowed image file size is from 1KB to 6MB.

  * "targetFace" rectangle should contain one face. Zero or multiple faces will be regarded as an error. If the provided "targetFace" rectangle is not returned from [Face - Detect](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/detectwithurl), thereâ€™s no guarantee to detect and add the face successfully.

  * Out of detectable face size (36x36 - 4096x4096 pixels), large head-pose, or large occlusions will cause failures.

  * Adding/deleting faces to/from a same face list are processed sequentially and to/from different face lists are in parallel.

  * The minimum detectable face size is 36x36 pixels in an image no larger than 1920x1080 pixels. Images with dimensions higher than 1920x1080 pixels will need a proportionally larger minimum face size.

  * Different 'detectionModel' values can be provided. To use and compare different detection models, please refer to [How to specify a detection model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/face/face-api-how-to-topics/specify-detection-model).


  Quota:

  * Free-tier subscription quota: 1,000 faces per large face list.

  * S0-tier subscription quota: 1,000,000 faces per large face list.
