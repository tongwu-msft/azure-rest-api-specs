  description: List of network mappings. As with NetworkMapping, it should be possible to reuse a prev version of this class. It doesn't seem likely this class could be anything more than a slightly bespoke collection of NetworkMapping. Hence it makes sense to override Load with Base.NetworkMapping instead of existing CurrentVersion.NetworkMapping.

  description: Network Mapping model. Ideally it should have been possible to inherit this class from prev version in InheritedModels as long as there is no difference in structure or method signature. Since there were no base Models for certain fields and methods viz NetworkMappingProperties and Load with required return type, the class has been introduced in its entirety with references to base models to facilitate exensions in subsequent versions.
