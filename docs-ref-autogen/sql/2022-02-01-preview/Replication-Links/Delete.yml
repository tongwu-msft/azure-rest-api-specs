     * 409 GeoReplicationCannotBecomePrimaryDuringUndo - User attempted to failover or force-terminate a geo-link while the secondary is in a state where it may not be physically consistent and so cannot enter the primary role.

     * 409 DuplicateGeoDrRelation - The databases are already in a replication relation. This is a duplicate request.
