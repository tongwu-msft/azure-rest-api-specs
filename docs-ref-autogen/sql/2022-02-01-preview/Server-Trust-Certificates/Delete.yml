Please provide subnet with same DNS zone, create a new subnet or provide empty one.\n\n * 400 MigrationToGen4SubnetNotSupported - It is not possible to update subnet while running on Gen4 hardware as it is being deprecated. Please upgrade your hardware from Gen4 to Gen5 as part of the changing managed instance subnet operation by specifying both parameters at the same time: destination subnet and hardware generation.\n\n * 400 PrimaryIdentityMissingPermissionForKeyId - KeyId is provided by user during create but PrimaryUserAssignedIdentityId is not provided in the API call\n\n * 400 InvalidIdentityTypeForKeyId - KeyId is provided by user during create but identity type is not set to 'UserAssigned'\n\n * 400 ServerNotFound - The requested server was not found.\n\n * 400 ManagedInstanceFileExceededMaxAzureStorageFileSizeLimit - The operation could not be completed because some of the database files are exceeding maximum General Purpose file size limit of {0} GB.\n\n * 400 InstancePoolNotEnoughCapacity - An instance pool does not have enough capacity\n\n * 400 SourceAndTargetSubnetsMustBeVnetPeered - Subnet currently used by managed instance and provided destination subnet are part of the virtual networks that are not connected with virtual network peering, or have peering established but don't have allowed traffic.
