      Default: regular database creation.


      Copy: creates a database as a copy of an existing database. sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the resource ID of the source database.


      Secondary: creates a database as a secondary replica of an existing database. sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the resource ID of the existing primary database.
