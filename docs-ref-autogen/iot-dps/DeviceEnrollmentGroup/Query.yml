Possible values include 'hashed': Linked IoT hubs are equally likely to have devices provisioned to them, 'geoLatency':  Devices are provisioned to an IoT hub with the lowest latency to the device.If multiple linked IoT hubs would provide the same lowest latency, the provisioning service hashes devices across those hubs, 'static' : Specification of the desired IoT hub in the enrollment list takes priority over the service-level allocation policy, 'custom': Devices are provisioned to an IoT hub based on your own custom logic. The provisioning service passes information about the device to the logic, and the logic returns the desired IoT hub as well as the desired initial configuration. We recommend using Azure Functions to host your logic."
