responses:
- name: 202 Accepted
  description: The provisioning service resource provider always returns a 202 Accepted status code with valid Location and Retry-After headers. The resource provider also sets the Azure-AsyncOperation header with a URL that points to the operation resource for this operation. Subsequent GET attempts on the resource after a DELETE operation return a resource representation that indicates a transitional provisioning state (such as Terminating). To retrieve the status of the operation, a client can either poll the URL returned in the Location header after the Retry-After interval, get the provisioning service status directly, or query the operation resource.
- name: 200 OK
  description: This is returned as a response to the status polling request for the delete operation. The body contains the resource representation that indicates a transitional provisioning state.
- name: 204 No Content
  description: Once the long running delete operation completes successfully, a 204 No Content status code is returned when the status polling request finds the provisioning service metadata in the service and the status of the delete operation is set to a completed state.
- name: 404 Not Found
  description: After the long running delete operation completes successfully, a 404 Not Found is returned when the status polling request no longer finds the provisioning service metadata in the service.
