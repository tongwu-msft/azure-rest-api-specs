- uid: keyvault.verify.verify
  summary: Verifies a signature using a specified key. The VERIFY operation is applicable to symmetric keys stored in Azure Key Vault. VERIFY is not strictly necessary for asymmetric keys stored in Azure Key Vault since signature verification can be performed using the public portion of the key but this operation is supported as a convenience for callers that only have a key-reference and not the public portion of the key. This operation requires the keys/verify permission.
