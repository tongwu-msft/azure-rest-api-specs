  summary: "Recovers the deleted key to its latest version.  \nThe Recover Deleted Key operation is applicable for deleted keys in soft-delete enabled vaults. It recovers the deleted key back to its latest version under /keys. An attempt to recover an non-deleted key will return an error. Consider this the inverse of the delete operation on soft-delete enabled vaults. This operation requires the keys/recover permission."
