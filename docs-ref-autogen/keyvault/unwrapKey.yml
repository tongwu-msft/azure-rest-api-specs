  summary: "Unwraps a symmetric key using the specified key that was initially used for wrapping that key.  \nThe UNWRAP operation supports decryption of a symmetric key using the target key encryption key. This operation is the reverse of the WRAP operation. The UNWRAP operation applies to asymmetric and symmetric keys stored in Azure Key Vault since it uses the private portion of the key. This operation requires the keys/unwrapKey permission."
