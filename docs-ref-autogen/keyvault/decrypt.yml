  summary: "Decrypts a single block of encrypted data.  \nThe DECRYPT operation decrypts a well-formed block of ciphertext using the target encryption key and specified algorithm. This operation is the reverse of the ENCRYPT operation; only a single block of data may be decrypted, the size of this block is dependent on the target key and the algorithm to be used. The DECRYPT operation applies to asymmetric and symmetric keys stored in Azure Key Vault since it uses the private portion of the key. This operation requires the keys/decrypt permission."
