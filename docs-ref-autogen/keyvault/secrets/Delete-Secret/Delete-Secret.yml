    description: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is an irreversible operation, without the possibility for recovery.

    - uid: string
  - name: Recoverable+Purgeable
    description: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable, and which also permits immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge). This level guarantees the recoverability of the deleted entity during the retention interval (90 days), unless a Purge operation is requested, or the subscription is cancelled. System wil permanently delete it after 90 days, if not recovered
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Recoverable
    description: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable without the possibility for immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge). This level guarantees the recoverability of the deleted entity during the retention interval(90 days) and while the subscription is still available. System wil permanently delete it after 90 days, if not recovered

    description: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable, and which also permits immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge when 7<= SoftDeleteRetentionInDays < 90).
