  properties:
  - name: Purgeable
    description: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is an irreversible operation, without the possibility for recovery. This level corresponds to no protection being available against a Delete operation; the data is irretrievably lost upon accepting a Delete operation at the entity level or higher (vault, resource group, subscription etc.)
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Recoverable+Purgeable
    description: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable, and which also permits immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge). This level guarantees the recoverability of the deleted entity during the retention interval (90 days), unless a Purge operation is requested, or the subscription is cancelled. System wil permanently delete it after 90 days, if not recovered
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Recoverable
    description: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable without the possibility for immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge). This level guarantees the recoverability of the deleted entity during the retention interval(90 days) and while the subscription is still available. System wil permanently delete it after 90 days, if not recovered
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Recoverable+ProtectedSubscription
    description: Denotes a vault and subscription state in which deletion is recoverable within retention interval (90 days), immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge) is not permitted, and in which the subscription itself  cannot be permanently canceled. System wil permanently delete it after 90 days, if not recovered

    description: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable, and which also permits immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge when 7<= SoftDeleteRetentionInDays < 90).
