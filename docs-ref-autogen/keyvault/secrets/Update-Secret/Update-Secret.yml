    description: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable, and which also permits immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge).

System wil permanently delete it after 90 days, if not recovered
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Recoverable
    description: Denotes a vault state in which deletion is recoverable without the possibility for immediate and permanent deletion (i.e. purge).
