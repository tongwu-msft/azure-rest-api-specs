### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Creates or updates a management lock at the subscription level. When you apply a lock at a parent scope, all child resources inherit the same lock. To create management locks, you must have access to Microsoft.Authorization/* or Microsoft.Authorization/locks/* actions. Of the built-in roles, only Owner and User Access Administrator are granted those actions.
