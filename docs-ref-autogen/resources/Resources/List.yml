  description: "The filter to apply on the operation.<br><br>The properties you can use for eq (equals) or ne (not equals) are: location, resourceType, name, resourceGroup, identity, identity/principalId, plan, plan/publisher, plan/product, plan/name, plan/version, and plan/promotionCode.<br><br>For example, to filter by a resource type, use: $filter=resourceType eq 'Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks'<br><br>You can use substringof(value, property) in the filter. The properties you can use for substring are: name and resourceGroup.<br><br>For example, to get all resources with 'demo' anywhere in the name, use: $filter=substringof('demo', name)<br><br>You can link more than one substringof together by adding and/or operators.<br><br>You can filter by tag names and values. For example, to filter for a tag name and value, use $filter=tagName eq 'tag1' and tagValue eq 'Value1'. When you filter by a tag name and value, the tags for each resource are not returned in the results.<br><br>You can use some properties together when filtering. The combinations you can use are: substringof and/or resourceType, plan and plan/publisher and plan/name, identity and identity/principalId."
