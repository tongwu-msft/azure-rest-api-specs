For example, to filter for a tag name and value, use `$filter=tagName eq 'tag1' and tagValue eq 'Value1'`. Note that when resources are filtered by tag name and value, <b>the original tags for each resource will not be returned in the results.</b> Any list of additional properties queried via `$expand` may also not be compatible when filtering by tag names/values. <br><br>For tag names only, resources can be filtered by prefix using the following syntax: `$filter=startswith(tagName, 'depart')`. This query will return all resources with a tag name prefixed by the phrase `depart` (i.e.`department`, `departureDate`, `departureTime`, etc.)<br><br><br>Note that some properties can be combined when filtering resources, which include the following: `substringof() and/or resourceType`, `plan and plan/publisher and plan/name`, and `identity and identity/principalId`."
