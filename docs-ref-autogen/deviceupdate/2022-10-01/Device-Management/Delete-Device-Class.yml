summary: Deletes a device class. Device classes are created automatically when Device Update-enabled devices are connected to the hub but are not automatically cleaned up since they are referenced by DeviceClassSubgroups. If the user has deleted all DeviceClassSubgroups for a device class they can also delete the device class to remove the records from the system and to stop checking the compatibility of this device class with new updates. If a device is ever reconnected for this device class it will be re-created.
