apiVersion: "3.1"
summary: >-
  Optical Character Recognition (OCR) detects text in an image and extracts the recognized characters into a machine-usable character stream.

  Upon success, the OCR results will be returned.

  Upon failure, the error code together with an error message will be returned. The error code can be one of InvalidImageUrl, InvalidImageFormat, InvalidImageSize, NotSupportedImage, NotSupportedLanguage, or InternalServerError.

  description: The OCR results in the hierarchy of region/line/word. The results include text, bounding box for regions, lines and words. The angle, in radians, of the detected text with respect to the closest horizontal or vertical direction. After rotating the input image clockwise by this angle, the recognized text lines become horizontal or vertical. In combination with the orientation property it can be used to overlay recognition results correctly on the original image, by rotating either the original image or recognition results by a suitable angle around the center of the original image. If the angle cannot be confidently detected, this property is not present. If the image contains text at different angles, only part of the text will be recognized correctly.
