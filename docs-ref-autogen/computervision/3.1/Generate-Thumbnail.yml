  summary: >-
    This operation generates a thumbnail image with the user-specified width and height. By default, the service analyzes the image, identifies the region of interest (ROI), and generates smart cropping coordinates based on the ROI. Smart cropping helps when you specify an aspect ratio that differs from that of the input image.

    A successful response contains the thumbnail image binary. If the request failed, the response contains an error code and a message to help determine what went wrong.

    Upon failure, the error code and an error message are returned. The error code could be one of InvalidImageUrl, InvalidImageFormat, InvalidImageSize, InvalidThumbnailSize, NotSupportedImage, FailedToProcess, Timeout, or InternalServerError.
