  summary: "Get tagged images for a given project iteration.  \nThis API supports batching and range selection. By default it will only return first 50 images matching images.\nUse the {take} and {skip} parameters to control how many images to return in a given batch.\nThe filtering is on an and/or relationship. For example, if the provided tag ids are for the \"Dog\" and\n\"Cat\" tags, then only images tagged with Dog and/or Cat will be returned"
