- uid: cognitiveservices.translator.documenttranslation.canceltranslation
  summary: >-
    Cancel a currently processing or queued translation.

    Cancel a currently processing or queued translation.

    A translation will not be cancelled if it is already completed or failed or cancelling. A bad request will be returned.

    All documents that have completed translation will not be cancelled and will be charged.

    All pending documents will be cancelled if possible.

  summary: "Returns the status for all documents in a batch document translation request.\r\n            \r\nIf the number of documents in the response exceeds our paging limit, server-side paging is used.\r\nPaginated responses indicate a partial result and include a continuation token in the response. The absence of a continuation token means that no additional pages are available.\r\n            \r\n$top, $skip and $maxpagesize query parameters can be used to specify a number of results to return and an offset for the collection.\r\n            \r\n$top indicates the total number of records the user wants to be returned across all pages.\r\n$skip indicates the number of records to skip from the list of document status held by the server based on the sorting method specified.  By default, we sort by descending start time.\r\n$maxpagesize is the maximum items returned in a page.  If more items are requested via $top (or $top is not specified and there are more items to be returned), @nextLink will contain the link to the next page.\r\n            \r\n$orderBy query parameter can be used to sort the returned list (ex \"$orderBy=createdDateTimeUtc asc\" or \"$orderBy=createdDateTimeUtc desc\").\r\nThe default sorting is descending by createdDateTimeUtc.\r\nSome query parameters can be used to filter the returned list (ex: \"status=Succeeded,Cancelled\") will only return succeeded and cancelled documents.\r\ncreatedDateTimeUtcStart and createdDateTimeUtcEnd can be used combined or separately to specify a range of datetime to filter the returned list by.\r\nThe supported filtering query parameters are (status, ids, createdDateTimeUtcStart, createdDateTimeUtcEnd).\r\n            \r\nWhen both $top and $skip are included, the server should first apply $skip and then $top on the collection.\r\nNote: If the server can't honor $top and/or $skip, the server must return an error to the client informing about it instead of just ignoring the query options.\r\nThis reduces the risk of the client making assumptions about the data returned."

  summary: >-
    Returns the status for a document translation request.

    The status includes the overall request status, as well as the status for documents that are being translated as part of that request.
- uid: cognitiveservices.translator.documenttranslation.starttranslation
  summary: "Submit a document translation request to the Document Translation service  \nUse this API to submit a bulk (batch) translation request to the Document Translation service.\nEach request can contain multiple documents and must contain a source and destination container for each document.\n            \nThe prefix and suffix filter (if supplied) are used to filter folders. The prefix is applied to the subpath after the container name.\n            \nGlossaries / Translation memory can be included in the request and are applied by the service when the document is translated.\n            \nIf the glossary is invalid or unreachable during translation, an error is indicated in the document status.\nIf a file with the same name already exists at the destination, it will be overwritten. The targetUrl for each target language must be unique."
