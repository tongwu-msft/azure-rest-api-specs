summary: "Returns a list of batch requests submitted and the status for each request.\r\nThis list only contains batch requests submitted by the user (based on the resource).\r\n            \r\nIf the number of requests exceeds our paging limit, server-side paging is used. Paginated responses indicate a partial result and include a continuation token in the response.\r\nThe absence of a continuation token means that no additional pages are available.\r\n            \r\n$top, $skip and $maxpagesize query parameters can be used to specify a number of results to return and an offset for the collection.\r\n            \r\n$top indicates the total number of records the user wants to be returned across all pages.\r\n$skip indicates the number of records to skip from the list of batches based on the sorting method specified.  By default, we sort by descending start time.\r\n$maxpagesize is the maximum items returned in a page.  If more items are requested via $top (or $top is not specified and there are more items to be returned), @nextLink will contain the link to the next page.\r\n            \r\n$orderBy query parameter can be used to sort the returned list (ex \"$orderBy=createdDateTimeUtc asc\" or \"$orderBy=createdDateTimeUtc desc\").\r\nThe default sorting is descending by createdDateTimeUtc.\r\nSome query parameters can be used to filter the returned list (ex: \"status=Succeeded,Cancelled\") will only return succeeded and cancelled operations.\r\ncreatedDateTimeUtcStart and createdDateTimeUtcEnd can be used combined or separately to specify a range of datetime to filter the returned list by.\r\nThe supported filtering query parameters are (status, ids, createdDateTimeUtcStart, createdDateTimeUtcEnd).\r\n            \r\nThe server honors the values specified by the client. However, clients must be prepared to handle responses that contain a different page size or contain a continuation token.\r\n            \r\nWhen both $top and $skip are included, the server should first apply $skip and then $top on the collection.\r\nNote: If the server can't honor $top and/or $skip, the server must return an error to the client informing about it instead of just ignoring the query options.\r\nThis reduces the risk of the client making assumptions about the data returned."
