summary: "Returns a list of batch requests submitted and the status for each request  \nReturns a list of batch requests submitted and the status for each request.\nThis list only contains batch requests submitted by the user (based on the subscription). The status for each request is sorted by id.\n            \nIf the number of requests exceeds our paging limit, server-side paging is used. Paginated responses indicate a partial result and include a continuation token in the response.\nThe absence of a continuation token means that no additional pages are available.\n            \n$top and $skip query parameters can be used to specify a number of results to return and an offset for the collection.\n            \nThe server honors the values specified by the client. However, clients must be prepared to handle responses that contain a different page size or contain a continuation token.\n            \nWhen both $top and $skip are included, the server should first apply $skip and then $top on the collection.\nNote: If the server can't honor $top and/or $skip, the server must return an error to the client informing about it instead of just ignoring the query options.\nThis reduces the risk of the client making assumptions about the data returned."
