      # Request body

      The body of the request is a JSON array. Each array element is a JSON object with the following properties:

      * `Text-` A string specifying the term to lookup. This should be the value of a `normalizedText` field from the back-translations of a previous Dictionary lookup request. It can also be the value of the `normalizedSource` field.

      * `Translation-` A string specifying the translated text previously returned by the Dictionary lookup operation. This should be the value from the `normalizedTarget` field in the `translations` list of the Dictionary lookup response. The service will return examples for the specific source-target word-pair.


      The following limitations apply:

      * The array can have at most 10 elements.

      * The text value of an array element cannot exceed 100 characters including spaces.


      # Response body

      A successful response is a JSON array with one result for each string in the input array. A result object includes the following properties:

      * `normalizedSource-` A string giving the normalized form of the source term. Generally, this should be identical to the value of the `Text` field at the matching list index in the body of the request.

      * `normalizedTarget-` A string giving the normalized form of the target term. Generally, this should be identical to the value of the `Translation` field at the matching list index in the body of the request.

      * `examples-` A list of examples for the (source term, target term) pair. Each element of the list is an object with the following properties:
        * `sourcePrefix-` The string to concatenate before the value of `sourceTerm` to form a complete example. Do not add a space character, since it is already there when it should be. This value may be an empty string.
        * `sourceTerm-` A string equal to the actual term looked up. The string is added with `sourcePrefix` and `sourceSuffix` to form the complete example. Its value is separated so it can be marked in a user interface, e.g., by bolding it.
        * `sourceSuffix-` The string to concatenate after the value of `sourceTerm` to form a complete example. Do not add a space character, since it is already there when it should be. This value may be an empty string.
        * `targetPrefix-` A string similar to `sourcePrefix` but for the target.
        * `targetTerm-` A string similar to `sourceTerm` but for the target.
        * `targetSuffix-` A string similar to `sourceSuffix` but for the target.

      # Response Header

      X-RequestId - Value generated by the service to identify the request. It is used for troubleshooting purposes.

      NOTE - If there are no examples in the dictionary, the response is 200 (OK) but the `examples` list is an empty list.

  description: A client-generated GUID to uniquely identify the request. Note that you can omit this header if you include the trace ID in the query string using a query parameter named ClientTraceId.
