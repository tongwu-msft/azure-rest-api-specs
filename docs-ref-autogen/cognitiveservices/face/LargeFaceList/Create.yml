apiVersion: "1.0"
summary: >-
  Create an empty large face list with user-specified largeFaceListId, name, an optional userData and recognitionModel.

  <br /> Large face list is a list of faces, up to 1,000,000 faces, and used by [Face - Find Similar](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395237).

  <br /> After creation, user should use [LargeFaceList Face - Add](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a158c10d2de3616c086f2d3) to import the faces and [LargeFaceList - Train](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a158422d2de3616c086f2d1) to make it ready for [Face - Find Similar](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395237). No image will be stored. Only the extracted face features are stored on server until [LargeFaceList - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a1580d5d2de3616c086f2cd) is called.

  <br /> Find Similar is used for scenario like finding celebrity-like faces, similar face filtering, or as a light way face identification. But if the actual use is to identify person, please use [PersonGroup](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395244) / [LargePersonGroup](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599acdee6ac60f11b48b5a9d) and [Face - Identify](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395239).

  <br/>'recognitionModel' should be specified to associate with this large face list. The default value for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the latest model needed, please explicitly specify the model you need in this parameter. New faces that are added to an existing large face list will use the recognition model that's already associated with the collection. Existing face features in a large face list can't be updated to features extracted by another version of recognition model.

  * 'recognition_01': The default recognition model for [LargeFaceList- Create](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a157b68d2de3616c086f2cc). All those large face lists created before 2019 March are bonded with this recognition model.

  * 'recognition_02': Recognition model released in 2019 March. 'recognition_02' is recommended since its overall accuracy is improved compared with 'recognition_01'.


  Large face list quota:

  * Free-tier subscription quota: 64 large face lists.

  * S0-tier subscription quota: 1,000,000 large face lists.
