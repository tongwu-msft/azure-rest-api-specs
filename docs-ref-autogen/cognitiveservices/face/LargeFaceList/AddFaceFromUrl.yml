summary: >-
  Add a face to a specified large face list, up to 1,000,000 faces.

  <br /> To deal with an image contains multiple faces, input face can be specified as an image with a targetFace rectangle. It returns a persistedFaceId representing the added face. No image will be stored. Only the extracted face feature will be stored on server until [LargeFaceList Face - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a158c8ad2de3616c086f2d4) or [LargeFaceList - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a1580d5d2de3616c086f2cd) is called.

  <br /> Note persistedFaceId is different from faceId generated by [Face - Detect](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236).

  * Higher face image quality means better recognition precision. Please consider high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size is 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.

  * JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported. The allowed image file size is from 1KB to 6MB.

  * "targetFace" rectangle should contain one face. Zero or multiple faces will be regarded as an error. If the provided "targetFace" rectangle is not returned from [Face - Detect](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236), thereâ€™s no guarantee to detect and add the face successfully.

  * Out of detectable face size (36x36 - 4096x4096 pixels), large head-pose, or large occlusions will cause failures.

  * Adding/deleting faces to/from a same face list are processed sequentially and to/from different face lists are in parallel.

  * The minimum detectable face size is 36x36 pixels in an image no larger than 1920x1080 pixels. Images with dimensions higher than 1920x1080 pixels will need a proportionally larger minimum face size.

  * Different 'detectionModel' values can be provided. To use and compare different detection models, please refer to [How to specify a detection model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/face-api-how-to-topics/specify-detection-model)
    | Model | Recommended use-case(s) |
    | ---------- | -------- |
    | 'detection_01': | The default detection model for [LargeFaceList - Add Face](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a158c10d2de3616c086f2d3). Recommend for near frontal face detection. For scenarios with exceptionally large angle (head-pose) faces, occluded faces or wrong image orientation, the faces in such cases may not be detected. |
    | 'detection_02': | Detection model released in 2019 May with improved accuracy especially on small, side and blurry faces. |

  Quota:

  * Free-tier subscription quota: 1,000 faces per large face list.

  * S0-tier subscription quota: 1,000,000 faces per large face list.
