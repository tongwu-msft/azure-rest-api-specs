  summary: >-
    Create a new large person group with user-specified largePersonGroupId, name, an optional userData and recognitionModel.

    <br /> A large person group is the container of the uploaded person data, including face recognition feature, and up to 1,000,000

    people.

    <br /> After creation, use [LargePersonGroup Person - Create](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599adcba3a7b9412a4d53f40) to add person into the group, and call [LargePersonGroup - Train](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599ae2d16ac60f11b48b5aa4) to get this group ready for [Face - Identify](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395239).

    <br /> No image will be stored. Only the person's extracted face features and userData will be stored on server until [LargePersonGroup Person - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599ade5c6ac60f11b48b5aa2) or [LargePersonGroup - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599adc216ac60f11b48b5a9f) is called.

    <br/>'recognitionModel' should be specified to associate with this large person group. The default value for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the latest model needed, please explicitly specify the model you need in this parameter. New faces that are added to an existing large person group will use the recognition model that's already associated with the collection. Existing face features in a large person group can't be updated to features extracted by another version of recognition model.

    * 'recognition_01': The default recognition model for [LargePersonGroup - Create](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599acdee6ac60f11b48b5a9d). All those large person groups created before 2019 March are bonded with this recognition model.

    * 'recognition_02': Recognition model released in 2019 March. 'recognition_02' is recommended since its overall accuracy is improved compared with 'recognition_01'.


    Large person group quota:

    * Free-tier subscription quota: 1,000 large person groups.

    * S0-tier subscription quota: 1,000,000 large person groups.

  summary: >
    Retrieve the information of a large person group, including its name, userData and recognitionModel. This API returns large person group information only, use [LargePersonGroup Person - List](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599adda06ac60f11b48b5aa1) instead to retrieve person information under the large person group.
- uid: cognitiveservices.largepersongroup.gettrainingstatus
  summary: Retrieve the training status of a large person group (completed or ongoing).
- uid: cognitiveservices.largepersongroup.list
  summary: >
    List all existing large person groups’ largePersonGroupId, name, userData and recognitionModel.<br />

    * Large person groups are stored in alphabetical order of largePersonGroupId.

    * "start" parameter (string, optional) is a user-provided largePersonGroupId value that returned entries have larger ids by string comparison. "start" set to empty to indicate return from the first item.

    * "top" parameter (int, optional) specifies the number of entries to return. A maximal of 1000 entries can be returned in one call. To fetch more, you can specify "start" with the last returned entry’s Id of the current call.

    <br />

    For example, total 5 large person groups: "group1", ..., "group5".

    <br /> "start=&top=" will return all 5 groups.

    <br /> "start=&top=2" will return "group1", "group2".

    <br /> "start=group2&top=3" will return "group3", "group4", "group5".
