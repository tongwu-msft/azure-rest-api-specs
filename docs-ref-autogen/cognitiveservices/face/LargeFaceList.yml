- uid: cognitiveservices.largefacelist.addfacefromstream
  summary: Add a face to a large face list. The input face is specified as an image with a targetFace rectangle. It returns a persistedFaceId representing the added face, and persistedFaceId will not expire.
- uid: cognitiveservices.largefacelist.addfacefromurl

  summary: >
    Create an empty large face list with user-specified largeFaceListId, name, an optional userData and recognitionModel.

    <br /> Large face list is a list of faces, up to 1,000,000 faces, and used by [Face - Find Similar](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395237).

    <br /> After creation, user should use [LargeFaceList Face - Add](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a158c10d2de3616c086f2d3) to import the faces and [LargeFaceList - Train](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a158422d2de3616c086f2d1) to make it ready for [Face - FindSimilar](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395237). Faces are stored on server until [LargeFaceList - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a1580d5d2de3616c086f2cd) is called.

    <br /> Find Similar is used for scenario like finding celebrity-like faces, similar face filtering, or as a light way face identification. But if the actual use is to identify person, please use [PersonGroup](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395244) / [LargePersonGroup](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599acdee6ac60f11b48b5a9d) and [Face - Identify](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395239).

    'recognitionModel' should be specified to associate with this large face list. The default value for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the latest model needed, please explicitly specify the model you need in this parameter. New faces that are added to an existing large face list will use the recognition model that's already associated with the collection. Existing face features in a large face list can't be updated to features extracted by another version of recognition model.

- uid: cognitiveservices.largefacelist.deleteface

- uid: cognitiveservices.largefacelist.get
  summary: Retrieve a large face list’s largeFaceListId, name, userData and recognitionModel.

  summary: Retrieve the training status of a large face list (completed or ongoing).
- uid: cognitiveservices.largefacelist.list
  summary: "List large face lists’ information of largeFaceListId, name, userData and recognitionModel. <br /> \nTo get face information inside largeFaceList use [LargeFaceList Face - Get](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a158cf2d2de3616c086f2d5)<br />\n* Large face lists are stored in alphabetical order of largeFaceListId.\n* \"start\" parameter (string, optional) is a user-provided largeFaceListId value that returned entries have larger ids by string comparison. \"start\" set to empty to indicate return from the first item.\n* \"top\" parameter (int, optional) specifies the number of entries to return. A maximal of 1000 entries can be returned in one call. To fetch more, you can specify \"start\" with the last retuned entry’s Id of the current call.\n<br />\nFor example, total 5 large person lists: \"list1\", ..., \"list5\".\n<br /> \"start=&top=\" will return all 5 lists.\n<br /> \"start=&top=2\" will return \"list1\", \"list2\".\n<br /> \"start=list2&top=3\" will return \"list3\", \"list4\", \"list5\".\n"
