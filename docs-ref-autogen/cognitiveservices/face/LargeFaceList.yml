- uid: cognitiveservices.largefacelist.addfacefromstream
  summary: Add a face to a large face list. The input face is specified as an image with a targetFace rectangle. It returns a persistedFaceId representing the added face, and persistedFaceId will not expire.
- uid: cognitiveservices.largefacelist.addfacefromurl
  summary: >-
    Add a face to a specified large face list, up to 1,000,000 faces.

    <br /> To deal with an image contains multiple faces, input face can be specified as an image with a targetFace rectangle. It returns a persistedFaceId representing the added face. No image will be stored. Only the extracted face feature will be stored on server until [LargeFaceList Face - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a158c8ad2de3616c086f2d4) or [LargeFaceList - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a1580d5d2de3616c086f2cd) is called.

    <br /> Note persistedFaceId is different from faceId generated by [Face - Detect](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236).

    * Higher face image quality means better recognition precision. Please consider high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size is 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.

    * JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported. The allowed image file size is from 1KB to 6MB.

    * "targetFace" rectangle should contain one face. Zero or multiple faces will be regarded as an error. If the provided "targetFace" rectangle is not returned from [Face - Detect](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236), there’s no guarantee to detect and add the face successfully.

    * Out of detectable face size (36x36 - 4096x4096 pixels), large head-pose, or large occlusions will cause failures.

    * Adding/deleting faces to/from a same face list are processed sequentially and to/from different face lists are in parallel.


    Quota:

    * Free-tier subscription quota: 1,000 faces per large face list.

    * S0-tier subscription quota: 1,000,000 faces per large face list.
- uid: cognitiveservices.largefacelist.create
  summary: >-
    Create an empty large face list with user-specified largeFaceListId, name, an optional userData and recognitionModel.

    <br /> Large face list is a list of faces, up to 1,000,000 faces, and used by [Face - Find Similar](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395237).

    <br /> After creation, user should use [LargeFaceList Face - Add](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a158c10d2de3616c086f2d3) to import the faces and [LargeFaceList - Train](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a158422d2de3616c086f2d1) to make it ready for [Face - Find Similar](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395237). No image will be stored. Only the extracted face features are stored on server until [LargeFaceList - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a1580d5d2de3616c086f2cd) is called.

    <br /> Find Similar is used for scenario like finding celebrity-like faces, similar face filtering, or as a light way face identification. But if the actual use is to identify person, please use [PersonGroup](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395244) / [LargePersonGroup](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599acdee6ac60f11b48b5a9d) and [Face - Identify](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395239).

    <br/>'recognitionModel' should be specified to associate with this large face list. The default value for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the latest model needed, please explicitly specify the model you need in this parameter. New faces that are added to an existing large face list will use the recognition model that's already associated with the collection. Existing face features in a large face list can't be updated to features extracted by another version of recognition model.

    * 'recognition_01': The default recognition model for [LargeFaceList- Create](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a157b68d2de3616c086f2cc). All those large face lists created before 2019 March are bonded with this recognition model.

    * 'recognition_02': Recognition model released in 2019 March. 'recognition_02' is recommended since its overall accuracy is improved compared with 'recognition_01'.


    Large face list quota:

    * Free-tier subscription quota: 64 large face lists.

    * S0-tier subscription quota: 1,000,000 large face lists.
