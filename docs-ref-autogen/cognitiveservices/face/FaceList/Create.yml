apiVersion: "1.0"
summary: >-
  Create an empty face list with user-specified faceListId, name, an optional userData and recognitionModel. Up to 64 face lists are allowed in one subscription.

  <br /> Face list is a list of faces, up to 1,000 faces, and used by [Face - Find Similar](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395237).

  <br /> After creation, user should use [FaceList - Add Face](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395250) to import the faces. No image will be stored. Only the extracted face features are stored on server until [FaceList - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f3039524f) is called.

  <br /> Find Similar is used for scenario like finding celebrity-like faces, similar face filtering, or as a light way face identification. But if the actual use is to identify person, please use [PersonGroup](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395244) / [LargePersonGroup](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599acdee6ac60f11b48b5a9d) and [Face - Identify](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395239).

  <br /> Please consider [LargeFaceList](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/5a157b68d2de3616c086f2cc) when the face number is large. It can support up to 1,000,000 faces.

  <br />'recognitionModel' should be specified to associate with this face list. The default value for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the latest model needed, please explicitly specify the model you need in this parameter. New faces that are added to an existing face list will use the recognition model that's already associated with the collection. Existing face features in a face list can't be updated to features extracted by another version of recognition model.

  * 'recognition_01': The default recognition model for [FaceList- Create](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f3039524b). All those face lists created before 2019 March are bonded with this recognition model.

  * 'recognition_02': Recognition model released in 2019 March. 'recognition_02' is recommended since itsÂ overall accuracy is improved compared with 'recognition_01'.
