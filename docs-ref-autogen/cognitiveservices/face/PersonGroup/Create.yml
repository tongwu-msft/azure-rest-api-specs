summary: >
  Create a new person group with specified personGroupId, name, user-provided userData and recognitionModel.

  <br /> A person group is the container of the uploaded person data, including face images and face recognition features.

  <br /> After creation, use [PersonGroup Person - Create](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f3039523c) to add persons into the group, and then call [PersonGroup - Train](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395249) to get this group ready for [Face - Identify](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395239).

  <br /> The person's face, image, and userData will be stored on server until [PersonGroup Person - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f3039523d) or [PersonGroup - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395245) is called.

  <br />

  * Free-tier subscription quota: 1,000 person groups. Each holds up to 1,000 persons.

  * S0-tier subscription quota: 1,000,000 person groups. Each holds up to 10,000 persons.

  * to handle larger scale face identification problem, please consider using [LargePersonGroup](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599acdee6ac60f11b48b5a9d).

  <br />

  'recognitionModel' should be specified to associate with this person group. The default value for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the latest model needed, please explicitly specify the model you need in this parameter. New faces that are added to an existing person group will use the recognition model that's already associated with the collection. Existing face features in a person group can't be updated to features extracted by another version of recognition model.
