    description: 'Operation status: notstarted, running, succeeded, failed. If the operation is requested and waiting to perform, the status is notstarted. If the operation is ongoing in backend, the status is running. Status succeeded means the operation is completed successfully, specifically for snapshot taking operation, it illustrates the snapshot is well taken and ready to apply, and for snapshot applying operation, it presents the target object has finished creating by the snapshot and ready to be used. Status failed is often caused by editing the source object while taking the snapshot or editing the target object while applying the snapshot before completion, see the field "message" to check the failure reason.'
