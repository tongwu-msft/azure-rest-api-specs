  summary: Add a representative face to a person for identification. The input face is specified as an image with a targetFace rectangle.

  summary: >-
    Add a face to a person into a large person group for face identification or verification. To deal with an image contains multiple faces, input face can be specified as an image with a targetFace rectangle. It returns a persistedFaceId representing the added face. No image will be stored. Only the extracted face feature will be stored on server until [LargePersonGroup PersonFace - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599ae2966ac60f11b48b5aa3), [LargePersonGroup Person - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599ade5c6ac60f11b48b5aa2) or [LargePersonGroup - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599adc216ac60f11b48b5a9f) is called.

    <br /> Note persistedFaceId is different from faceId generated by [Face - Detect](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236).

    *   Higher face image quality means better recognition precision. Please consider high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size is 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.

    *   Each person entry can hold up to 248 faces.

    *   JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported. The allowed image file size is from 1KB to 6MB.

    *   "targetFace" rectangle should contain one face. Zero or multiple faces will be regarded as an error. If the provided "targetFace" rectangle is not returned from [Face - Detect](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236), there’s no guarantee to detect and add the face successfully.

    *   Out of detectable face size (36x36 - 4096x4096 pixels), large head-pose, or large occlusions will cause failures.

    *   Adding/deleting faces to/from a same person will be processed sequentially. Adding/deleting faces to/from different persons are processed in parallel.
