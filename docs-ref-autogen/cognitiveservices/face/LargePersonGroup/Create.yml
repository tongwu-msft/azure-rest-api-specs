name: Create
service: Cognitive Services
groupName: Large Person Group
apiVersion: "1.0"
summary: >-
  Create a new large person group with user-specified largePersonGroupId, name, an optional userData and recognitionModel.

  <br /> A large person group is the container of the uploaded person data, including face recognition feature, and up to 1,000,000

  people.

  <br /> After creation, use [LargePersonGroup Person - Create](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599adcba3a7b9412a4d53f40) to add person into the group, and call [LargePersonGroup - Train](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599ae2d16ac60f11b48b5aa4) to get this group ready for [Face - Identify](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395239).

  <br /> No image will be stored. Only the person's extracted face features and userData will be stored on server until [LargePersonGroup Person - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599ade5c6ac60f11b48b5aa2) or [LargePersonGroup - Delete](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599adc216ac60f11b48b5a9f) is called.

  <br/>'recognitionModel' should be specified to associate with this large person group. The default value for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the latest model needed, please explicitly specify the model you need in this parameter. New faces that are added to an existing large person group will use the recognition model that's already associated with the collection. Existing face features in a large person group can't be updated to features extracted by another version of recognition model.

  * 'recognition_01': The default recognition model for [LargePersonGroup - Create](/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/599acdee6ac60f11b48b5a9d). All those large person groups created before 2019 March are bonded with this recognition model.

  * 'recognition_02': Recognition model released in 2019 March. 'recognition_02' is recommended since its overall accuracy is improved compared with 'recognition_01'.


  Large person group quota:

  * Free-tier subscription quota: 1,000 large person groups.

  * S0-tier subscription quota: 1,000,000 large person groups.
