  summary: 'This operation recognizes content within an image by applying a domain-specific model.  The list of domain-specific models that are supported by the Computer Vision API can be retrieved using the /models GET request.  Currently, the API only provides a single domain-specific model: celebrities. Two input methods are supported -- (1) Uploading an image or (2) specifying an image URL. A successful response will be returned in JSON.  If the request failed, the response will contain an error code and a message to help understand what went wrong.'
