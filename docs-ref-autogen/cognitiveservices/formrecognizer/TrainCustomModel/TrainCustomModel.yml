summary: "Train Model  \nCreate and train a custom model. The train request must include a source parameter that is either an externally accessible Azure Storage blob container Uri (preferably a Shared Access Signature Uri) or valid path to a data folder in a locally mounted drive. When local paths are specified, they must follow the Linux/Unix path format and be an absolute path rooted to the input mount configuration\n setting value e.g., if '{Mounts:Input}' configuration setting value is '/input' then a valid source path would be '/input/contosodataset'. All data to be trained is expected to be directly under the source folder. Subfolders are not supported. Models are trained using documents that are of the following content type - 'application/pdf', 'image/jpeg' and 'image/png'.\"\n Other type of content is ignored."
