  summary: "Returns the status for all documents in a batch document translation request  \nReturns the status for all documents in a batch document translation request.\n            \nThe documents included in the response are sorted by document Id in descending order. If the number of documents in the response exceeds our paging limit, server-side paging is used.\nPaginated responses indicate a partial result and include a continuation token in the response. The absence of a continuation token means that no additional pages are available.\n            \n$top and $skip query parameters can be used to specify a number of results to return and an offset for the collection.\nThe server honors the values specified by the client. However, clients must be prepared to handle responses that contain a different page size or contain a continuation token.\n            \nWhen both $top and $skip are included, the server should first apply $skip and then $top on the collection.\nNote: If the server can't honor $top and/or $skip, the server must return an error to the client informing about it instead of just ignoring the query options.\nThis reduces the risk of the client making assumptions about the data returned."
