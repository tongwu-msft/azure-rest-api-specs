      # Request Body

      The body of the request is a JSON array. Each array element is a JSON object with a string property named Text. Language detection is applied to the value of the Text property.

      The following limitations apply:

      * The array can have at most 100 elements.

      * The text value of an array element cannot exceed 10,000 characters including spaces.

      * The entire text included in the request cannot exceed 50,000 characters including spaces.


      # Response Body

      A successful response is a JSON array with one result for each string in the input array. A result object includes the following properties:

      * language- Code of the detected language.

      * score- A float value indicating the confidence in the result. The score is between zero and one and a low score indicates a low confidence.

      * isTranslationSupported- A boolean value which is true if the detected language is one of the languages supported for text translation. Not all detected languages can be translated by the API.

      * isTransliterationSupported- A boolean value which is true if the detected language is one of the languages supported for transliteration.

      * alternatives- An array of other possible languages. Each element of the array is another object with the same properties listed above- language, score, isTranslationSupported and isTransliterationSupported.
