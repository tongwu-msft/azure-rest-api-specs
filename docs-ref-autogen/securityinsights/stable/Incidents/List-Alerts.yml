  - name: Probing
    description: Probing could be an attempt to access a certain resource regardless of a malicious intent or a failed attempt to gain access to a target system to gather information prior to exploitation. This step is usually detected as an attempt originating from outside the network in attempt to scan the target system and find a way in.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Exploitation
    description: Exploitation is the stage where an attacker manage to get foothold on the attacked resource. This stage is applicable not only for compute hosts, but also for resources such as user accounts, certificates etc. Adversaries will often be able to control the resource after this stage.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Persistence
    description: Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a system that gives an adversary a persistent presence on that system. Adversaries will often need to maintain access to systems through interruptions such as system restarts, loss of credentials, or other failures that would require a remote access tool to restart or alternate backdoor for them to regain access.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: PrivilegeEscalation
    description: Privilege escalation is the result of actions that allow an adversary to obtain a higher level of permissions on a system or network. Certain tools or actions require a higher level of privilege to work and are likely necessary at many points throughout an operation. User accounts with permissions to access specific systems or perform specific functions necessary for adversaries to achieve their objective may also be considered an escalation of privilege.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: DefenseEvasion
    description: 'Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may use to evade detection or avoid other defenses. Sometimes these actions are the same as or variations of techniques in other categories that have the added benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation. '

    - uid: string
  - name: CredentialAccess
    description: Credential access represents techniques resulting in access to or control over system, domain, or service credentials that are used within an enterprise environment.

With sufficient access within a network, an adversary can create accounts for later use within the environment.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Discovery
    description: Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the system and internal network. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system provides many native tools that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: LateralMovement
    description: Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an adversary to access and control remote systems on a network and could, but does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The lateral movement techniques could allow an adversary to gather information from a system without needing additional tools, such as a remote access tool. An adversary can use lateral movement for many purposes, including remote Execution of tools, pivoting to additional systems, access to specific information or files, access to additional credentials, or to cause an effect.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Execution
    description: The execution tactic represents techniques that result in execution of adversary-controlled code on a local or remote system. This tactic is often used in conjunction with lateral movement to expand access to remote systems on a network.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Collection
    description: Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: Exfiltration
    description: Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the adversary removing files and information from a target network. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.

  - name: CommandAndControl
    description: The command and control tactic represents how adversaries communicate with systems under their control within a target network.
    types:
