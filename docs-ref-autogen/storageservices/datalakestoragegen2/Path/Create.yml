The sticky bit is also supported and in symbolic notation, its represented either by the letter t or T in the final character-place depending on whether the execution bit for the others category is set or unset respectively (e.g. rwxrw-rw- with sticky bit is represented as rwxrw-rwT. A rwxrw-rwx with sticky bit is represented as rwxrw-rwt), absence of t or T indicates sticky bit not set. In 4-digit octal notation, its represented by 1st digit (e.g. 1766 represents rwxrw-rw- with sticky bit and 0766 represents rwxrw-rw- without sticky bit). Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-acl.

  description: Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace is enabled for the account. When creating a file or directory and the parent folder does not have a default ACL, the umask restricts the permissions of the file or directory to be created.  The resulting permission is given by p & ^u, where p is the permission and u is the umask.  For example, if p is 0777 and u is 0057, then the resulting permission is 0720.  The default permission is 0777 for a directory and 0666 for a file.  The default umask is 0027.  The umask must be specified in 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766).

  description: "Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace is enabled for the account. Sets POSIX access control rights on files and directories. Each access control entry (ACE) consists of a scope, a type, a user or group identifier, and permissions in the format \"[scope:][type]:[id]:[permissions]\". The scope must be \"default\" to indicate the ACE belongs to the default ACL for a directory; otherwise scope is implicit and the ACE belongs to the access ACL.  There are four ACE types: \"user\" grants rights to the owner or a named user, \"group\" grants rights to the owning group or a named group, \"mask\" restricts rights granted to named users and the members of groups, and \"other\" grants rights to all users not found in any of the other entries. The user or group identifier is omitted for entries of type \"mask\" and \"other\".  The user or group identifier is also omitted for the owner and owning group.  The permission field is a 3-character sequence where the first character is 'r' to grant read access, the second character is 'w' to grant write access, and the third character is 'x' to grant execute permission.  If access is not granted, the '-' character is used to denote that the permission is denied. For example, the following ACL grants read, write, and execute rights to the file owner and john.doe@contoso, the read right to the owning group, and nothing to everyone else: \"user::rwx,user:john.doe@contoso:rwx,group::r--,other::---,mask=rwx\".
