summary: "Create File | Create Directory | Rename File | Rename Directory  \nCreate or rename a file or directory.    By default, the destination is overwritten and if the destination already exists and has a lease the lease is broken.  This operation supports conditional HTTP requests.  For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/specifying-conditional-headers-for-blob-service-operations).  To fail if the destination already exists, use a conditional request with If-None-Match: \"*\"."
