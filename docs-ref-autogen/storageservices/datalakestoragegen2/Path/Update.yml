summary: "Append Data | Flush Data | Set Properties | Set Access Control  \nUploads data to be appended to a file, flushes (writes) previously uploaded data to a file, sets properties for a file or directory, or sets access control for a file or directory. Data can only be appended to a file. Concurrent writes to the same file using multiple clients are not supported. This operation supports conditional HTTP requests. For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/specifying-conditional-headers-for-blob-service-operations)."

  description: The file or directory path.
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: action
  in: query
  isRequired: true
  description: The action must be "append" to upload data to be appended to a file, "flush" to flush previously uploaded data to a file, "setProperties" to set the properties of a file or directory, or "setAccessControl" to set the owner, group, permissions, or access control list for a file or directory, or "setAccessControlRecursive" to set the access control list for a directory recursively. Note that Hierarchical Namespace must be enabled for the account in order to use access control.  Also note that the Access Control List (ACL) includes permissions for the owner, owning group, and others, so the x-ms-permissions and x-ms-acl request headers are mutually exclusive.
  types:
  - uid: PathUpdateAction
- name: position
  in: query
  description: This parameter allows the caller to upload data in parallel and control the order in which it is appended to the file.  It is required when uploading data to be appended to the file and when flushing previously uploaded data to the file.  The value must be the position where the data is to be appended.  Uploaded data is not immediately flushed, or written, to the file.  To flush, the previously uploaded data must be contiguous, the position parameter must be specified and equal to the length of the file after all data has been written, and there must not be a request entity body included with the request.
  types:
  - uid: integer
  format: int64
- name: retainUncommittedData
  in: query
  description: Valid only for flush operations.  If "true", uncommitted data is retained after the flush operation completes; otherwise, the uncommitted data is deleted after the flush operation.  The default is false.  Data at offsets less than the specified position are written to the file when flush succeeds, but this optional parameter allows data after the flush position to be retained for a future flush operation.
  types:
  - uid: boolean
- name: close
  in: query
  description: Azure Storage Events allow applications to receive notifications when files change. When Azure Storage Events are enabled, a file changed event is raised. This event has a property indicating whether this is the final change to distinguish the difference between an intermediate flush to a file stream and the final close of a file stream. The close query parameter is valid only when the action is "flush" and change notifications are enabled. If the value of close is "true" and the flush operation completes successfully, the service raises a file change notification with a property indicating that this is the final update (the file stream has been closed). If "false" a change notification is raised indicating the file has changed. The default is false. This query parameter is set to true by the Hadoop ABFS driver to indicate that the file stream has been closed."
  types:
  - uid: boolean
- name: mode
  in: query
  description: Optional. Valid and required for "setAccessControlRecursive" operation.

  types:
  - uid: string
- name: maxRecords
  in: query
  description: Optional and valid only for "setAccessControlRecursive" operation. It specifies the maximum number of files or directories on which the acl change will be applied. If omitted or greater than 2,000, the request will process up to 2,000 items
  types:

  format: int32
- name: forceFlag
  in: query
  description: Optional and valid only for "setAccessControlRecursive" operation. If this is "false" operation will terminate fast on encountering user errors (4XX). If "true" the api will ignore user errors and proceed with the operation on other sub-entities of the directory. Detailed status of user errors will be returned in the response for either scenario. Continuation token will only be returned when forceFlag is "true" in case of user errors. Default value for forceFlag is false.
  types:
  - uid: boolean
- name: continuation
  in: query
  description: Optional and valid only for "setAccessControlRecursive" operation. The number of paths processed with each invocation is limited. If the number of paths to be processed exceeds this limit, a continuation token is returned in the response header x-ms-continuation. When a continuation token is returned in the response, it must be percent-encoded and specified in a subsequent invocation of setAccessControlRecursive operation.
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: flush
  in: query
  description: Valid only for append calls. This parameter allows the caller to flush during an append call. Default value is "false" , if "true" the data will be flushed with the append call. Note that when using flush=true, the following headers are not supported - "x-ms-cache-control", "x-ms-content-encoding", "x-ms-content-type", "x-ms-content-language", "x-ms-content-md5", "x-ms-content-disposition". To set these headers during flush, please use action=flush

Note that the string may only contain ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set. Valid only for the setProperties operation. If the file or directory exists, any properties not included in the list will be removed.  All properties are removed if the header is omitted.

Each class may be granted read (4), write (2), or execute (1) permission. Both symbolic (rwxrw-rw-) and 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766) are supported. The sticky bit is also supported and in symbolic notation, its represented either by the letter t or T in the final character-place depending on whether the execution bit for the others category is set or unset respectively (e.g. rwxrw-rw- with sticky bit is represented as rwxrw-rwT. A rwxrw-rwx with sticky bit is represented as rwxrw-rwt), absence of t or T indicates sticky bit not set. In 4-digit octal notation, its represented by 1st digit (e.g. 1766 represents rwxrw-rw- with sticky bit and 0766 represents rwxrw-rw- without sticky bit). Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-acl.
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: x-ms-acl
  in: header
  description: "Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl and setAccessControlRecursive operations. Required for setAccessControlRecursive operation. Sets POSIX access control rights on files and directories. The value is a comma-separated list of access control entries that fully replaces the existing access control list (ACL) in case of setAccessControl and \"set\" mode of setAccessControlRecursive. \"modify\" mode of setAccessControlRecursive updates the pre-existing ACLS. Each access control entry (ACE) consists of a scope, a type, a user or group identifier, and permissions in the format \"[scope:][type]:[id]:[permissions]\". The scope must be \"default\" to indicate the ACE belongs to the default ACL for a directory; otherwise scope is implicit and the ACE belongs to the access ACL.  There are four ACE types: \"user\" grants rights to the owner or a named user, \"group\" grants rights to the owning group or a named group, \"mask\" restricts rights granted to named users and the members of groups, and \"other\" grants rights to all users not found in any of the other entries. The user or group identifier is omitted for entries of type \"mask\" and \"other\".  The user or group identifier is also omitted for the owner and owning group.  The permission field is a 3-character sequence where the first character is 'r' to grant read access, the second character is 'w' to grant write access, and the third character is 'x' to grant execute permission.  If access is not granted, the '-' character is used to denote that the permission is denied. For example, the following ACL grants read, write, and execute rights to the file owner and john.doe@contoso, the read right to the owning group, and nothing to everyone else: \"user::rwx,user:john.doe@contoso:rwx,group::r--,other::---,mask=rwx\". Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-permissions. \"remove\" mode of setAccessControlRecursive removes the pre-existing ACLs and should not contain permissions in the access control list specified : \"user:john.doe@contoso:, mask:\". \"set\" mode of setAccessControlRecursive sets the ACLs replacing the pre-existing ACLs of the scope specified and must contain all three - owning user, owning group and other info if access scope is getting set or if either of owning user, owning group or other is being set in default scope. \"set\" and \"modify\" modes of setAccessControlRecursive must contain permissions as part of access control list."

Note that Hierarchical Namespace must be enabled for the account in order to use access control.  Also note that the Access Control List (ACL) includes permissions for the owner, owning group, and others, so the x-ms-permissions and x-ms-acl request headers are mutually exclusive.
