summary: "Append Data | Flush Data | Set Properties | Set Access Control  \nUploads data to be appended to a file, flushes (writes) previously uploaded data to a file, sets properties for a file or directory, or sets access control for a file or directory. Data can only be appended to a file. This operation supports conditional HTTP requests. For more information, see [Specifying Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/specifying-conditional-headers-for-blob-service-operations)."

  isRequired: true
  description: The file or directory path.
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: action
  in: query
  isRequired: true
  description: The action must be "append" to upload data to be appended to a file, "flush" to flush previously uploaded data to a file, "setProperties" to set the properties of a file or directory, or "setAccessControl" to set the owner, group, permissions, or access control list for a file or directory.  Note that Hierarchical Namespace must be enabled for the account in order to use access control.  Also note that the Access Control List (ACL) includes permissions for the owner, owning group, and others, so the x-ms-permissions and x-ms-acl request headers are mutually exclusive.
  types:
  - uid: PathUpdateAction
- name: position
  in: query
  description: This parameter allows the caller to upload data in parallel and control the order in which it is appended to the file.  It is required when uploading data to be appended to the file and when flushing previously uploaded data to the file.  The value must be the position where the data is to be appended.  Uploaded data is not immediately flushed, or written, to the file.  To flush, the previously uploaded data must be contiguous, the position parameter must be specified and equal to the length of the file after all data has been written, and there must not be a request entity body included with the request.
  types:
  - uid: integer
  format: int64
- name: retainUncommittedData
  in: query
  description: Valid only for flush operations.  If "true", uncommitted data is retained after the flush operation completes; otherwise, the uncommitted data is deleted after the flush operation.  The default is false.  Data at offsets less than the specified position are written to the file when flush succeeds, but this optional parameter allows data after the flush position to be retained for a future flush operation.
  types:
  - uid: boolean
- name: timeout
  in: query
  description: An optional operation timeout value in seconds. The period begins when the request is received by the service. If the timeout value elapses before the operation completes, the operation fails.

Valid only for the setProperties operation.  If the file or directory exists, any properties not included in the list will be removed.  All properties are removed if the header is omitted.

  in: header
  description: Optional and only valid if Hierarchical Namespace is enabled for the account. Sets POSIX access permissions for the file owner, the file owning group, and others. Each class may be granted read, write, or execute permission.  The sticky bit is also supported.  Both symbolic (rwxrw-rw-) and 4-digit octal notation (e.g. 0766) are supported. Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-acl.
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: x-ms-acl
  in: header
  description: "Optional and valid only for the setAccessControl operation. Sets POSIX access control rights on files and directories. The value is a comma-separated list of access control entries that fully replaces the existing access control list (ACL).  Each access control entry (ACE) consists of a scope, a type, a user or group identifier, and permissions in the format \"[scope:][type]:[id]:[permissions]\". The scope must be \"default\" to indicate the ACE belongs to the default ACL for a directory; otherwise scope is implicit and the ACE belongs to the access ACL.  There are four ACE types: \"user\" grants rights to the owner or a named user, \"group\" grants rights to the owning group or a named group, \"mask\" restricts rights granted to named users and the members of groups, and \"other\" grants rights to all users not found in any of the other entries. The user or group identifier is omitted for entries of type \"mask\" and \"other\".  The user or group identifier is also omitted for the owner and owning group.  The permission field is a 3-character sequence where the first character is 'r' to grant read access, the second character is 'w' to grant write access, and the third character is 'x' to grant execute permission.  If access is not granted, the '-' character is used to denote that the permission is denied. For example, the following ACL grants read, write, and execute rights to the file owner and john.doe@contoso, the read right to the owning group, and nothing to everyone else: \"user::rwx,user:john.doe@contoso:rwx,group::r--,other::---,mask=rwx\". Invalid in conjunction with x-ms-permissions."
