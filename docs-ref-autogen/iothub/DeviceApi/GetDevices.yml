summary: Get the identities of multiple devices from the IoT hub identity registry. Get the identities of multiple devices from the IoT hub identity registry. Returns the specified number of devices from the IoT hub's identity registry. If a limit is not specified, it returns up to 1000 identities. Pagination of device identities is not supported. This API is targeted at development and test scenarios. For large scale operations, consider using the export feature using blob storage(https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry#import-and-export-device-identities)
