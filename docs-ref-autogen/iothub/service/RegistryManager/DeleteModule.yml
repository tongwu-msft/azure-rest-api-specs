summary: "Delete the module identity for device of an IoT hub. This request requires the If-Match header. The client may specify the ETag for the device identity on the request in order to compare to the ETag maintained by the service for the purpose of optimistic concurrency. The delete operation is performed only if the ETag sent by the client matches the value maintained by the server, indicating that the device identity has not been modified since it was retrieved by the client. To force an unconditional delete, set If-Match to the wildcard character (*).  \n For IoT Hub VNET related features(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/virtual-network-support) please use API version '2020-03-13'.These features are currently in general availability in the East US, West US 2, and Southcentral US regions only. We are actively working to expand the availability of these features to all regions by end of month May. For rest of the APIs please continue using API version '2019-10-01'"
