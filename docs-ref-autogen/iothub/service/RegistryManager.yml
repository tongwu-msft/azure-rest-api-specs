  summary: "Create, update, or delete the identities of multiple devices from the IoT hub identity registry.  \nCreate, update, or delete the identiies of multiple devices from the IoT hub identity registry. A device identity can be specified only once in the list. Different operations (create, update, delete) on different devices are allowed. A maximum of 100 devices can be specified per invocation. For large scale operations, consider using the import feature using blob storage(https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry#import-and-export-device-identities)."

  summary: "Create or update the identity of a device in the identity registry of an IoT hub.  \nCreate or update the identity of a device in the identity registry of an IoT hub. An ETag must not be specified for the create operation. An ETag must be specified for the update operation. Note that generationId and deviceId cannot be updated by the user."
- uid: fully-qualified-iothubname.azure-devices.net.iothub.service.registrymanager.createorupdatemodule
  summary: Create or update the module identity for device in IoT hub. An ETag must not be specified for the create operation. An ETag must be specified for the update operation. Note that moduleId and generation cannot be updated by the user.
- uid: fully-qualified-iothubname.azure-devices.net.iothub.service.registrymanager.deletedevice
  summary: "Delete the identity of a device from the identity registry of an IoT hub.  \nDelete the identity of a device from the identity registry of an IoT hub. This request requires the If-Match header. The client may specify the ETag for the device identity on the request in order to compare to the ETag maintained by the service for the purpose of optimistic concurrency. The delete operation is performed only if the ETag sent by the client matches the value maintained by the server, indicating that the device identity has not been modified since it was retrieved by the client. To force an unconditional delete, set If-Match to the wildcard character (*)."
