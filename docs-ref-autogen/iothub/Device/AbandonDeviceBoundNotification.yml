summary: "This method abandons a cloud-to-device message  \nThis method abandons a cloud-to-device message. The Etag obtained when the message was received must be provided to resolve race conditions when completing, rejecting, or abandoning a message. A abandoned message is put back in the device message queue for re-delivery to the device. See https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messaging for more information. Currently, the use of the Etag in the header does not comply with RFC 7232. A fix for this issue is currently on our backlog. This capability is only available in the standard tier IoT Hub. For more information, see [Choose the right IoT Hub tier](https://aka.ms/scaleyouriotsolution). For IoT Hub VNET related features(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/virtual-network-support) please use API version '2020-03-13'.These features are currently in general availability in the East US, West US 2, and Southcentral US regions only. We are actively working to expand the availability of these features to all regions by end of month May. For rest of the APIs please continue using API version '2019-10-01'"
