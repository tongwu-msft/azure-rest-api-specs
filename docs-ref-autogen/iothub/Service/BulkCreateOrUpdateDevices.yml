summary: "Create, update, or delete the identities of multiple devices from the IoT hub identity registry.  \nCreate, update, or delete the identiies of multiple devices from the IoT hub identity registry. A device identity can be specified only once in the list. Different operations (create, update, delete) on different devices are allowed. A maximum of 100 devices can be specified per invocation. For large scale operations, consider using the import feature using blob storage(https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry#import-and-export-device-identities)."
