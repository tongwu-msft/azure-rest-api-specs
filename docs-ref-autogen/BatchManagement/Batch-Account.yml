operations:
- uid: management.azure.com.batchmanagement.batchaccount.create
  summary: Creates a new Batch account with the specified parameters. Existing accounts cannot be updated with this API and should instead be updated with the Update Batch Account API.

  summary: Deletes the specified Batch account.
- uid: management.azure.com.batchmanagement.batchaccount.get
  summary: Gets information about the specified Batch account.
- uid: management.azure.com.batchmanagement.batchaccount.getkeys
  summary: "Gets the account keys for the specified Batch account.  \nThis operation applies only to Batch accounts with allowedAuthenticationModes containing 'SharedKey'. If the Batch account doesn't contain 'SharedKey' in its allowedAuthenticationMode, clients cannot use shared keys to authenticate, and must use another allowedAuthenticationModes instead. In this case, getting the keys will fail."
- uid: management.azure.com.batchmanagement.batchaccount.list
  summary: Gets information about the Batch accounts associated with the subscription.
- uid: management.azure.com.batchmanagement.batchaccount.listbyresourcegroup
  summary: Gets information about the Batch accounts associated with the specified resource group.
- uid: management.azure.com.batchmanagement.batchaccount.listoutboundnetworkdependenciesendpoints
  summary: Lists the endpoints that a Batch Compute Node under this Batch Account may call as part of Batch service administration. If you are deploying a Pool inside of a virtual network that you specify, you must make sure your network allows outbound access to these endpoints. Failure to allow access to these endpoints may cause Batch to mark the affected nodes as unusable. For more information about creating a pool inside of a virtual network, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-virtual-network.
- uid: management.azure.com.batchmanagement.batchaccount.regeneratekey
  summary: "Regenerates the specified account key for the Batch account.  \nThis operation applies only to Batch accounts with allowedAuthenticationModes containing 'SharedKey'. If the Batch account doesn't contain 'SharedKey' in its allowedAuthenticationMode, clients cannot use shared keys to authenticate, and must use another allowedAuthenticationModes instead. In this case, regenerating the keys will fail."
- uid: management.azure.com.batchmanagement.batchaccount.synchronizeautostoragekeys
  summary: Synchronizes access keys for the auto-storage account configured for the specified Batch account, only if storage key authentication is being used.
- uid: management.azure.com.batchmanagement.batchaccount.update
