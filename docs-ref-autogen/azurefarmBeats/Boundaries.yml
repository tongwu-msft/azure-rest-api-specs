    ###### Note:

    1. This API does a serial search of the database for the given search criteria. If the farmer Id is available, it is strongly recommended to use **‘List by Farmer Id’** API as it is performant.

    2. Users will get paginated response with each page containing a link to the next page. Few pages may have **no items (zero results)**. Users are expected to iterate over all the pages using ‘nextLink’. The search comes to an end when ‘nextLink’ is null.

- uid: azurefarmbeats.boundaries.listbyfarmerid
  summary: "Get a paginated list of boundary resources for a given farmer and search criteria.\n\n\r###### Note: \n1. Users will get paginated response with each page containing a link to the next page. Users are expected to iterate over all the pages using ‘nextLink’. The search comes to an end when ‘nextLink’ is null.\n\n"
- uid: azurefarmbeats.boundaries.search
  summary: >+
    Search for boundaries across all the farmers intersecting with a given geometry.

    This API is expected to be used when users want to find boundaries that intersect with a given geometry. Otherwise, this is functionally same as 'List' API for boundaries.
