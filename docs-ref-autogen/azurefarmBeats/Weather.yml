  summary: "Get a paginated list of weather data resources for a given search criteria.\n\n\r###### Note: \n1. Users will get paginated response with each page containing a link to the next page. Users are expected to iterate over all the pages using ‘nextLink’. The search comes to an end when ‘nextLink’ is null.\n2. This API will retrieve weather data present in the FarmBeats datastore and does not ingest new data. Example: a user has ingested historical weather data from 1st of Jan 2019 to 30th of June 2019. However, using the current API, the user has asked for historical data from 1st of Jan 2019 to 31st of December 2019. In such a case, only data for the first 6 months is returned to the user.\n\n"
