    ###### Note:


    1. The **‘contentType’** in the request header should be **'application/merge-patch+json'**.

    2. 'Id' of a resource can only contain alphanumeric characters, '-', '_', '~' or '.', and must begin and end with an alphanumeric character. Minimum length of an ‘Id’ is 2 characters and maximum length is 50 characters.

    3. 'Key' and 'value' in 'Properties' can have a maximum of 50 and 150 characters respectively.

    ###### Note:

    1. This API does a serial search of the database for the given search criteria. If the crop Id is available, it is strongly recommended to use **‘List by Crop Id’** API as it is performant.

    2. Users will get paginated response with each page containing a link to the next page. Few pages may have **no items (zero results)**. Users are expected to iterate over all the pages using ‘nextLink’. The search comes to an end when ‘nextLink’ is null.
