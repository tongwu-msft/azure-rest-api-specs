    ###### Note:

    1. This API does a serial search of the database for the given search criteria. If the farmer Id is available, it is strongly recommended to use **‘List by Farmer Id’** API as it is performant.

    2. Users will get paginated response with each page containing a link to the next page. Few pages may have **no items (zero results)**. Users are expected to iterate over all the pages using ‘nextLink’. The search comes to an end when ‘nextLink’ is null.
