  description: Number of desired alternative routes to be calculated.  Max value is 5
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: alternativeType
  in: query
  description: Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria.  Controls the optimality, with respect to the given planning criteria, of the calculated alternatives compared to the reference route. Possible values are anyRoute which allow any alternative route to be returned irrespective of how it compares to the reference route in terms of optimality, and betterRoute which return an alternative route only if it is better than the reference route according to the given planning criteria
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: minDeviationDistance
  in: query
  description: All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of meters. Can only be used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationDistance parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: minDeviationTime
  in: query
  description: All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: instructionsType
  in: query
  description: If specified, guidance instructions will be returned.  Possible values are coded which returns raw instruction data without human-readable messages, text which returns raw instructions data with human-readable messages in plain text, and tagged which returns raw instruction data with tagged human-readable messages to permit formatting. Note that the instructionsType parameter cannot be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation=none
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: language
  in: query
  description: The language parameter determines the language of the guidance messages. It does not affect proper nouns (the names of streets, plazas, etc.) It has no effect when instructionsType=coded.  Allowed values are (a subset of) the IETF language tags described
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: computeBestOrder
  in: query
  description: Re-order the route waypoints to reduce the route length. Yields best results when used in conjunction with routeType shortest. Possible values are true or false.  True computes a better order, if possible but is not allowed to be used in conjunction with maxAlternatives value greater than 0 or in conjunction with circle waypoints. The response will include the optimized waypoint indices and can be used with a maximum of 20 route waypoints.  False will use the locations in the given order and not allowed to be used in conjunction with routeRepresentation none
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: routeRepresentation
  in: query
  description: Specifies the representation of the set of routes provided as response. Possible values are polyline includes routes in the response, or none which includes only the optimized waypoint indices but does not include the routes in the response. This parameter value can only be used in conjunction with computeBestOrder true.
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: computeTravelTimeFor
  in: query
  description: Specifies whether to return additional travel times using different types of traffic information (none, historic, live) as well as the default best-estimate travel time.
