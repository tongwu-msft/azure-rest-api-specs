      dictionary of dictionaries. This is determined by your application, and

      typically includes features about the current user, their

      The set should not contain more than 50 actions.

      should match the sequence your application would have used to display them.

      The first item in the array will be used as Baseline item in Offline Evaluations.

      generator when making a Personalizer call.

      Reward to the event. Send true if it is possible the user will not see the action specified in the rank results,

      (e.g. because the page is rendering later, or the Rank results may be overridden by code further downstream).

      You must call the Activate Event API if the event output is shown to users, otherwise Rewards will be ignored.
