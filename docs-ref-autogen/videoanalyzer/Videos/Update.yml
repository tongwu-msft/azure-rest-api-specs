  description: Contains information about the video and audio content.
  kind: object
  properties:
  - name: segmentLength
    description: Video segment length indicates the length of individual video files (segments) which are persisted to storage. Smaller segments provide lower archive playback latency but generate larger volume of storage transactions. Larger segments reduce the amount of storage transactions while increasing the archive playback latency. Value must be specified in ISO8601 duration format (i.e. "PT30S" equals 30 seconds) and can vary between 30 seconds to 5 minutes, in 30 seconds increments.
    types:

- name: VideoArchival
  description: Video archival properties.
  kind: object
  properties:
  - name: retentionPeriod
    description: Video retention period indicates the maximum age of the video archive segments which are intended to be kept in storage. It must be provided in the ISO8601 duration format in the granularity of days, up to a maximum of 10 years. For example, if this is set to P30D (30 days), content older than 30 days will be periodically deleted. This value can be updated at any time and the new desired retention period will be effective within 24 hours.

  properties:
  - name: Archive
    description: Archive is flexible format that represents a video stream associated with wall-clock time. The video archive can either be continuous or discontinuous. An archive is discontinuous when there are gaps in the recording due to various reasons, such as the live pipeline being stopped, camera being disconnected or due to the use of event based recordings through the use of a signal gate. There is no limit to the archive duration and new video data can be appended to the existing archive at any time, as long as the same video codec and codec parameters are being used. Videos of this type are suitable for appending and long term archival.
