      Video streaming base URL for the video archive. When present, archived video can be played through the Azure Video Analyzer player. Alternatively, this URL can be used with compatible DASH or HLS players by appending the following to the base URL:

        - HLSv4:     /manifest(format=m3u8-aapl).m3u8
        - HLS CMAF:  /manifest(format=m3u8-cmaf)
        - DASH CMAF: /manifest(format=mpd-time-cmaf)

      Moreover, an ongoing video recording can be played in "live mode" with latencies which are approximately double of the chosen video segment length.

  kind: object
  properties:
  - name: segmentLength
    isReadyOnly: true
    description: Video segment length indicates the length of individual video files (segments) which are persisted to storage. Smaller segments provide lower archive playback latency but generate larger volume of storage transactions. Larger segments reduce the amount of storage transactions while increasing the archive playback latency. Value must be specified in ISO8601 duration format (i.e. "PT30S" equals 30 seconds) and can vary between 30 seconds to 5 minutes, in 30 seconds increments.

  kind: enum
  properties:
  - name: Archive
    description: Archive is flexible format that represents a video stream associated with wall-clock time. The video archive can either be continuous or discontinuous. An archive is discontinuous when there are gaps in the recording due to various reasons, such as the live pipeline being stopped, camera being disconnected or due to the use of event based recordings through the use of a signal gate. Finally, there is no limit to the archive duration and new video data can be appended to the existing archive at any time, as long as the same video codec and codec parameters are being used.
