  The Get Map Tiles API allows users to request map tiles in vector or raster formats typically to be integrated  into a map control or SDK. Some example tiles that can be requested are Azure Maps road tiles, real-time  Weather Radar tiles or the map tiles created using [Azure Maps Creator](https://aka.ms/amcreator). By default,  Azure Maps uses vector tiles for its web map control (Web SDK) and Android SDK.

    The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows you to show the correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically disputed regions. Different countries have different views of such regions, and the View parameter allows your application to comply with the view required by the country your application will be serving. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t defined it in  the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and then set the View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those  regarding mapping, of the country where maps, images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to  access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.

      Digital Elevation Model tiles. The tiles are in the GeoTIFF format with a single 32-bit floating point band. The tiles cover the whole landmass of Earth. Some small islands (e.g., atolls) might not be represented accurately.<br>

      * The vertical unit for measurement of elevation height is meters. An elevation value of -32767.0 is used for points that have no data value, most often returned where there isn't landmass (i.e. water).<br>

      * The horizontal reference datum is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84-G1150) and the vertical reference datum is the Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008).<br>

      * Tiles are 258x258 pixel squares rather than the standard 256 x 256. This is done to allow for accurate interpolation of values at the tile edges. As such adjacent tiles overlap by 1 pixel along all edges.<br>

      * Tile data comes from the [Airbus WorldDEM4Ortho product](https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/worlddem-streaming/). Urban areas are approximately leveled down to ground level. All other areas are represented by the object surface level (e.g., trees). <br>
