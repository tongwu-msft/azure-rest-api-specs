  Creator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps API and SDK. [This](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/creator-indoor-maps) article introduces concepts and tools that apply to Azure Maps Creator.


  This API allows the caller to create an alias. You can also assign the alias during the create request. An alias can reference an ID generated by a creator service, but cannot reference another alias ID.


  ### Submit Create Request


  To create your alias, you will use a `POST` request. If you would like to assign the alias during the creation, you will pass the `resourceId` query parameter.


  ### Create Alias Response


  The Create API returns a HTTP `201 Created` response with the alias resource in the body.


  A sample response from creating an alias:


  ```json

  {
    "createdTimestamp": "2020-02-13T21:19:11.123Z",
    "aliasId": "a8a4b8bb-ecf4-fb27-a618-f41721552766",
    "creatorDataItemId": "e89aebb9-70a3-8fe1-32bb-1fbd0c725f14",
    "lastUpdatedTimestamp": "2020-02-13T21:19:22.123Z"
  }

  ```

When paired with [Azure Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure Role based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Note\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* The Azure role based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."

For publicly exposed applications our recommendation is to use server to server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be  securely stored.
