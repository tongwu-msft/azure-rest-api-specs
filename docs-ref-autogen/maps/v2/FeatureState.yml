  summary: "**Applies to:** S1 pricing tier.\n<br>\n\nThis POST API allows the user to create a new Stateset and define stateset style using request body.\n\nCreator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps API and SDK. The Feature State API is part of Creator. \n\nThe Feature State service allows the user to update the states of a feature and query them to be used in other services. The dynamic properties of a feature that don't belong to the dataset are referred to as *states* here.\n\nThis Feature State service pivot on the Stateset. Like Tileset, Stateset encapsulates the storage mechanism for feature states for a dataset.\n\nOnce the stateset is created, users can use that statesetId to post feature state updates and retrieve the current feature states. A feature can have only one state at a given point in time. \n\nFeature state is defined by the key name, value and the timestamp. When a feature state update is posted to Azure Maps, the state value gets updated only if the provided stateâ€™s timestamp is later than the stored timestamp. \n\nAzure Maps MapControl provides a way to use these feature states to style the features. Please refer to the State Tile documentation for more information."
