      Digital Elevation Model tiles. The tiles are in the GeoTIFF format with a single 32-bit floating point band. The tiles cover the whole landmass of Earth. Some small islands (e.g., atolls) might not be represented accurately.<br>

      * The vertical unit for measurement of elevation height is meters. An elevation value of -32767.0 is used for points that have no data value, most often returned where there isn't landmass (i.e. water).<br>

      * The horizontal reference datum is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84-G1150) and the vertical reference datum is the Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008).<br>

      * Tiles are 258x258 pixel squares rather than the standard 256 x 256. This is done to allow for accurate interpolation of values at the tile edges. As such adjacent tiles overlap by 1 pixel along all edges.<br>

      * Tile data comes from the [Airbus WorldDEM4Ortho product](https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/worlddem-streaming/). Urban areas are approximately leveled down to ground level. All other areas are represented by the object surface level (e.g., trees). <br>

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview)  Flows. When paired with [Azure Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure Role based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Note\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* The Azure role based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."
