      Digital Elevation Model tiles. The tiles are in the GeoTIFF format with a single 32-bit floating point band. The tiles cover the whole landmass of Earth. Some small islands (e.g., atolls) might not be represented accurately.<br>

      * The vertical unit for measurement of elevation height is meters. An elevation value of -32767.0 is used for points that have no data value, most often returned where there isn't landmass (i.e. water).<br>

      * The horizontal reference datum is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84-G1150) and the vertical reference datum is the Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008).<br>

      * Tiles are 258x258 pixel squares rather than the standard 256 x 256. This is done to allow for accurate interpolation of values at the tile edges. As such adjacent tiles overlap by 1 pixel along all edges.<br>

      * Tile data comes from the [Airbus WorldDEM4Ortho product](https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/worlddem-streaming/). Urban areas are approximately leveled down to ground level. All other areas are represented by the object surface level (e.g., trees). <br>

When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0 or v2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) supports Work, School, and Guests but does not support Personal accounts."
