  summary: "**Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.\n\nThis API returns a FeatureCollection where each Feature is a buffer around the corresponding indexed Feature of the input. The buffer could be either on the outside or the inside of the provided Feature, depending on the distance provided in the input. There must be either one distance provided per Feature in the FeatureCollection  input, or if only one distance is provided, then that distance is applied to every Feature in the collection. The positive (or negative) buffer of a geometry is defined as the Minkowski sum (or difference) of the geometry with a circle of radius equal to the absolute value of the buffer distance. The buffer API always returns a polygonal result. The negative or zero-distance buffer of lines and points is always an empty polygon. The input features are provided by a GeoJSON file which is uploaded via [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadPreview) and referenced by a unique udid. The GeoJSON file may contain a collection of Point, MultiPoint, Polygon, MultiPolygon, LineString and MultiLineString. GeometryCollection will be ignored if provided. \n\nTo test this API, you can upload the sample data from [Post Buffer API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/spatial/postbuffer#examples) examples(Request Body without distances array) via [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadPreview) and replace the [udid] from the [sample request below](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/spatial/getbuffer#examples) with the udid returned by Data Upload API."

    **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.


    This API returns the closest point between a base point and a given set of points in the user uploaded data set identified by udid. The set of target points is provided by a GeoJSON file which is uploaded via [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadPreview) and referenced by a unique udid. The GeoJSON file may only contain a collection of Point geometry. MultiPoint or other geometries will be ignored if provided. The maximum number of points accepted is 100,000. The algorithm does not take into account routing or traffic. Information returned includes closest point latitude, longitude, and distance in meters from the closest point.

    This API will return the great-circle or shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, measured along the surface of the sphere.  This differs from calculating a straight line through the sphere's interior. This method is helpful for estimating travel distances for airplanes by calculating the shortest distance between airports.

    **Search Geofence Post API**

    **Applies to:** S1 Pricing tier.

    The Geofence Post API allows you to retrieve the proximity of a coordinate to a  provided geofence or set of fences. With POST call, you do not have to upload the fence data in advance, instead you supply the location of the object you are tracking in query parameters as well as the fence or set of fences data in post request body. See [Geofencing GeoJSON data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/geofence-geojson) for more details on the geofence data format. The response will contain information about the distance from the outer edge of the geofence. A negative value signifies that the  coordinate is inside of the fence while a positive value means that it is outside of the fence.<br><br>This API can be used for a variety of scenarios that include things like asset  tracking, fleet management, or setting up alerts for moving objects.


    The API supports [integration with Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/azure-maps-event-grid-integration).  The isAsync parameter is used to enable integration with Event Grid (disabled by default).
