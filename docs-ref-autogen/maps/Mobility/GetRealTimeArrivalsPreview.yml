  **Real-time Arrivals API**


  **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.


  Get Real Time Arrivals API returns for a given a stop, line or location the requested number of real-time arrivals. Endpoint support different modes to request real-time arrivals such as number of live arrivals for all lines arriving at the specified stop or all arrivals of a line to stops near the user’s location. The API supports parameters to request one or multiple public transit types such as bus, tram and subway, maximum number if arrivals, and prefer a specific transit agency operating in the area. In some cases real-time arrivals may not be available, for example, if arrival is too far in the future or transit vehicle does not have capability to share the real-time location. This is symbolized in a scheduleType field present in all responses.

When paired with [Azure Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure Role based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Note\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* The Azure role based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."
