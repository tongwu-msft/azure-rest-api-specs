summary: "Get Elevation Data Along a Polyline  \n**Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.\n\nThe Get Data for Polyline API provides elevation data along a polyline.\n\n A polyline is defined by  passing in between 2 and N endpoint coordinates separated by a pipe ('|') character. In addition  to passing in endpoints, customers can specify the number of sample points that will be used to divide  polyline into equally spaced segments. Elevation data at both start and endpoints and equally spaced  points along the polyline will be returned.\n\n A line between two endpoints is a straight Cartesian line, the  shortest line between those two points in the coordinate reference system. Note that the point is  chosen based on Euclidean distance and may markedly differ from the geodesic path along the curved  surface of the reference ellipsoid."

    The string representation of a polyline path. A polyline is defined by endpoint coordinates,  with each endpoint separated by a pipe ('|') character. The polyline should be defined in the  following format: `[longitude_point1, latitude_point1 | longitude_point2, latitude_point2, ...,  longitude_pointN, latitude_pointN]`.

     The longitude and latitude values refer to the World Geodetic  System (WGS84) coordinate reference system. The resolution of the data used to compute the  elevation depends on the distance between the endpoints.

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview)  Flows. When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."

    This is a shared key that is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to use server-to-server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be  securely stored.
