summary: "Get Elevation Data Along a Polyline  \n**Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).\n\n The Get Data for Polyline API provides elevation data along a polyline.\n\n A polyline is defined by passing in between 2 and N endpoint coordinates separated by a pipe ('|') character. In addition to passing in endpoints, customers can specify the number of sample points that will be used to divide polyline into equally spaced segments.\n\n Elevation data at both start and endpoints, as well as equally spaced points along the polyline will be returned. The results will be listed in the direction from the first endpoint towards the last endpoint. A line between two endpoints is a straight Cartesian line, the  shortest line between those two points in the coordinate reference system. Note that the point is  chosen based on Euclidean distance and may markedly differ from the geodesic path along the curved  surface of the reference ellipsoid."

    The string representation of a polyline path. A polyline is defined by endpoint coordinates,  with each endpoint separated by a pipe ('|') character. The polyline should be defined in the  following format: `[longitude_point1, latitude_point1 | longitude_point2, latitude_point2, ...,  longitude_pointN, latitude_pointN]`.

     The longitude and latitude values refer to the World Geodetic  System (WGS84) coordinate reference system. The resolution of the data used to compute the  elevation depends on the distance between the endpoints.

When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0 or v2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) supports Work, School, and Guests but does not support Personal accounts."

     With this key, any application can access all REST API. In other words, this key can be used as a master key in the account that they are issued in.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to use the [confidential client applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/authentication-best-practices#confidential-client-applications) approach to access Azure Maps REST APIs so your key can be securely stored.

     With this token, any application is authorized to access with Azure role-based access controls and fine-grain control to the expiration, rate, and region(s) of use for the particular token. In other words, the SAS Token can be used to allow applications to control access in a more secured way than the shared key.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to configure a specific list of allowed origins on the [Map account resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) to limit rendering abuse and regularly renew the SAS Token.
