    **Get Severe Weather Alerts**


    **Applies to**: S0 and S1 pricing tiers.


    Severe weather phenomenon can significantly impact our everyday life and business operations. For example, severe weather conditions such as tropical storms, high winds or flooding can close roads and force logistics companies to reroute their fleet causing delays in reaching destinations and breaking the cold chain of refrigerated food products.  Azure Maps Severe Weather Alerts API returns the severe weather alerts that are available worldwide from both official Government Meteorological Agencies and leading global to regional weather alert providers. The service can return details such as alert type, category, level and detailed description about the active severe alerts for the requested location, like hurricanes, thunderstorms, lightning, heat waves or forest fires.
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.weather.getweatheralongroute
  summary: "**Get Weather along route**\n   \n   \n **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.\n\n Weather along a route API returns hyper local (one kilometer or less), up-to-the-minute weather nowcasts, weather hazard assessments, and notifications along a route described as a sequence of waypoints. \n This includes a list of weather hazards affecting the waypoint or route, and the aggregated hazard index for each waypoint might be used to paint each portion of a route according to how safe it is for the driver. When submitting the waypoints, it is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or shortly after. Data is updated every five minutes. \n \n The service supplements Azure Maps [Route Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route) that allows you to first request a route between an origin and a destination and use that as an input for Weather Along Route endpoint.\n \n In addition, the service supports scenarios to generate weather notifications for waypoints that experience an increase in intensity of a weather hazard. For example, if the vehicle is expected to begin experiencing heavy rain as it reaches a waypoint, a weather notification for heavy rain will be generated for that waypoint allowing the end product to display a heavy rain notification before the driver reaches that waypoint. \n The trigger for when to display the notification for a waypoint could be based, for example, on a [geofence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/tutorial-iot-hub-maps), or selectable distance to the waypoint.\n\n The API covers all regions of the planet except latitudes above Greenland and Antarctica."
