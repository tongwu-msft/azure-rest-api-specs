  The Search Geometry endpoint allows you to perform a free form search inside a single geometry or many of them. The search results that fall inside the geometry/geometries will be returned.<br><br>To send the geometry you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the `geometry` object represented as a `GeoJSON` type and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. The geographical features to be searched can be modeled as Polygon and/or Circle geometries represented using any one of the following `GeoJSON` types:<ul><li>**GeoJSON FeatureCollection** <br>The `geometry` can be represented as a `GeoJSON FeatureCollection` object. This is the recommended option if the geometry contains both Polygons and Circles. The `FeatureCollection` can contain a max of 50 `GeoJSON Feature` objects. Each `Feature` object should represent either a Polygon or a Circle with the following conditions:<ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>A `Feature` object for the Polygon geometry can have a max of 50 coordinates and it's properties must be empty.</li><li>A `Feature` object for the Circle geometry is composed of a _center_ represented using a `GeoJSON Point` type and a _radius_ value (in meters) which must be specified in the object's properties along with the _subType_ property whose value should be 'Circle'.</li></ul><br> Please see the Examples section below for a sample `FeatureCollection` representation.<br><br></li><li>**GeoJSON GeometryCollection**<br>The `geometry` can be represented as a `GeoJSON GeometryCollection` object. This is the recommended option if the geometry contains a list of Polygons only. The `GeometryCollection` can contain a max of 50 `GeoJSON Polygon` objects. Each `Polygon` object can have a max of 50 coordinates. Please see the Examples section below for a sample `GeometryCollection` representation.<br><br></li><li>**GeoJSON Polygon**<br>The `geometry` can be represented as a `GeoJSON Polygon` object.

    The View parameter specifies which set of geopolitically disputed content is returned via Azure Maps services, including  borders and labels displayed on the map. The View parameter (also referred to as “user region parameter”) will show the  correct maps for that country/region. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t defined it in  the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and then set the View parameter correctly  for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those  regarding mapping, of the country where maps, images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to  access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.

When paired with [Azure Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure Role based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Note\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* The Azure role based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."

  description: This is a shared key which is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs. With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.  For publicly exposed applications our recommendation is to use server to server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be  securely stored.
