  The Search Along Route endpoint allows you to perform a fuzzy search for POIs along a specified route. This search is constrained by specifying the `maxDetourTime` limiting measure.<br><br>To send the route-points you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the `route` object represented as a `GeoJSON LineString` type and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Each route-point in `route` is represented as a `GeoJSON Position` type i.e. an array where the _longitude_ value is followed by the _latitude_ value and the _altitude_ value is ignored. The `route` should contain at least 2 route-points.<br><br>It is possible that original route will be altered, some of it's points may be skipped. If the route that passes through the found point is faster than the original one, the `detourTime` value in the response is negative.

    Available connector types are:
      * `StandardHouseholdCountrySpecific` - These are the standard household connectors for a certain region. They are all AC single phase and the standard Voltage and standard Amperage. See also: [Plug & socket types - World Standards](https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets).
      * `IEC62196Type1` - Type 1 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Also called Yazaki after the original manufacturer or SAE J1772 after the standard that first published it. Mostly used in combination with 120V single phase or up to 240V single phase infrastructure.
      * `IEC62196Type1CCS` - Type 1 based combo connector as defined in the IEC 62196-3 standard. The connector is based on the Type 1 connector – as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard – with two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow DC fast charging.
      * `IEC62196Type2CableAttached` - Type 2 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Provided as a cable and plug attached to the charging point.
      * `IEC62196Type2Outlet` - Type 2 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Provided as a socket set into the charging point.
      * `IEC62196Type2CCS` - Type 2 based combo connector as defined in the IEC 62196-3 standard. The connector is based on the Type 2 connector – as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard – with two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow DC fast charging.
      * `IEC62196Type3` - Type 3 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2 standard. Also called Scame after the original manufacturer. Mostly used in combination with up to 240V single phase or up to 420V three phase infrastructure.
      * `Chademo` - CHAdeMO connector named after an association formed by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and industrial partners. Because of this is is also known as the TEPCO's connector. It supports fast DC charging.
      * `IEC60309AC1PhaseBlue` - Industrial Blue connector is a connector defined in the IEC 60309 standard. It is sometime referred to as by some combination of the standard, the color and the fact that is a single phase connector. The connector usually has the "P+N+E, 6h" configuration.
      * `IEC60309DCWhite` - Industrial White connector is a DC connector defined in the IEC 60309 standard.
      * `Tesla` - The Tesla connector is the regionally specific Tesla Supercharger connector. I.e. it refers to either Tesla's proprietary connector, sometimes referred to as Tesla Port mostly limited to North America or the modified Type 2 (DC over Type 2) in Europe.

    Usage examples:

     connectorSet=IEC62196Type2CableAttached
     connectorSet=IEC62196Type2Outlet,IEC62196Type2CableAttached

    The View parameter specifies which set of geopolitically disputed content is returned via Azure Maps services, including  borders and labels displayed on the map. The View parameter (also referred to as “user region parameter”) will show the  correct maps for that country/region. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t defined it in  the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and then set the View parameter correctly  for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those  regarding mapping, of the country where maps, images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to  access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview)  Flows. When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."

    This is a shared key that is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to use server-to-server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be  securely stored.
