  **Get Polygon**


  The Get Polygon service allows you to request the geometry data such as a city or country  outline for a set of entities, previously retrieved from an Online Search request in GeoJSON format. The geometry  ID is returned in the dataSources object under "geometry" and "id" in either a Search Address or Search Fuzzy call.


  Please note that any geometry ID retrieved from an Online Search endpoint has a limited lifetime. The client  should not store geometry IDs in persistent storage for later referral, as the stability of these identifiers is  not guaranteed for a long period of time. It is expected that a request to the Polygon method is made within a  few minutes of the request to the Online Search method that provided the ID. The service allows for batch  requests up to 20 identifiers.
