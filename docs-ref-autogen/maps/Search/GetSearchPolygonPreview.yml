summary: '**Get Polygon**<br><br>The Get Polygon service allows you to request the geometry data such as a city or country outline for a set of entities, previously retrieved from an Online Search request in GeoJSON format. <br><br> Please note that any geometry ID retrieved from an Online Search endpoint has a limited lifetime. The client should not store geometry IDs in persistent storage for later referral,  as the stability of these identifiers is not guaranteed for a long period of time.  It is expected that a request to the Polygon method is made within a few minutes of the request to the Online Search method that provided the ID. The service allows for batch requests up to 20 identifiers.'
