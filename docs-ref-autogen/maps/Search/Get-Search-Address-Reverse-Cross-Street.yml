  **Reverse Geocode to a Cross Street**


  **Applies to**: S0 and S1 pricing tiers.



  There may be times when you need to translate a  coordinate (example: 37.786505, -122.3862) into a human understandable cross street. Most often this  is needed in tracking applications where you  receive a GPS feed from the device or asset and wish to know what address where the coordinate is  located.

  This endpoint will return cross street information  for a given coordinate.

    The View parameter specifies which set of geopolitically disputed content is returned via Azure Maps services, including  borders and labels displayed on the map. The View parameter (also referred to as “user region parameter”) will show the  correct maps for that country/region. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t defined it in  the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and then set the View parameter correctly  for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those  regarding mapping, of the country where maps, images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to  access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.

When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0 or v2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) supports Work, School, and Guests but does not support Personal accounts."

    This is a shared key that is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to use server-to-server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be securely stored.

    This is a shared access signature token is created from the List SAS operation on the [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

In other words, the SAS Token can be used to allow applications to control access in a more secured way than the shared key.
