  **Reverse Geocode to a Cross Street**


  **Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).


  There may be times when you need to translate a  coordinate (example: 37.786505, -122.3862) into a human understandable cross street. Most often this  is needed in tracking applications where you  receive a GPS feed from the device or asset and wish to know what address where the coordinate is  located.

  This endpoint will return cross street information  for a given coordinate.

    The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows you to show the correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically disputed regions. Different countries have different views of such regions, and the View parameter allows your application to comply with the view required by the country your application will be serving. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t defined it in  the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and then set the View parameter correctly for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those  regarding mapping, of the country where maps, images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to  access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.
