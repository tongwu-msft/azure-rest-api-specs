summary: '**Reverse Geocode to an Address**<br><br>There may be times when you need to translate a coordinate (example: 37.786505, -122.3862) into a human understandable street address. Most often this is needed in tracking applications where you receive a GPS feed from the device or asset and wish to know what address where the coordinate is located. This endpoint will return address information for a given coordinate.'
