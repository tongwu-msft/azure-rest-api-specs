summary: "\n\n**Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.\n\nThe Matrix Routing service allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries for a set of routes defined by origin and destination locations by using an asynchronous (async) or synchronous (sync) POST request. For every given origin, the service calculates the cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of origins and the set of destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in the table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an example, let's say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find the closest driver to pick up the delivery from the restaurant. To solve this use case, they can call Matrix Route API.\n\n\nFor each route, the travel times and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to determine which detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.\n\n\nThe maximum size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations).\n\n\n\n### Submit Synchronous Route Matrix Request\nIf your scenario requires synchronous requests and the maximum size of the matrix is less than or equal to 100, you might want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for this API is **100** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 10x10, 6x8, 9x8 (it does not need to be square).\n\n```\nPOST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/sync/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}\n```\n\n### Submit Asynchronous Route Matrix Request\nThe Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing big volumes of relatively complex routing requests. When you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a 202 response code along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This URL should be checked periodically until the response data or error information is available. If `waitForResults` parameter in the request is set to true, user will get a 200 response if the request is finished under 120 seconds.\n\n\nThe maximum size of a matrix for this API is **700** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations). With that constraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25. 10x70 (it does not need to be square).\n\n\nThe asynchronous responses are stored for **14** days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response if used after the expiration period.\n\n\n\n\n```\nPOST https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/json?api-version=1.0&subscription-key={subscription-key}\n```\n\nHere's a typical sequence of asynchronous operations:\n1. Client sends a Route Matrix POST request to Azure Maps\n\n2. The server will respond with one of the following:\n\n    > HTTP `202 Accepted` -  Route Matrix request has been accepted.\n\n    > HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Route Matrix request. This could either be a 400 Bad Request or any other Error status code.\n\n\n3. If the Matrix Route request was accepted successfully, the Location header in the response contains the URL to download the results of the request. This status URI looks like the following:\n\n  ```\n    GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}\n  ```\n\n\n4. Client issues a GET request on the download URL obtained in Step 3 to download the results\n\n### Download Sync Results\nWhen you make a POST request for Route Matrix Sync API, the service returns 200 response code for successful request and a response array. The response body will contain the data and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later.\n\n### Download Async Results\nWhen a request issues a `202 Accepted` response, the request is being processed using our async pipeline. You will be given a URL to check the progress of your  async request in the location header of the response. This status URI looks like the following:\n```\n  GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/matrix/{matrixId}?api-version=1.0?subscription-key={subscription-key}\n```\n\nThe URL provided by the location header will return the following responses when a `GET` request is issued.\n\n  > HTTP `202 Accepted` - Matrix request was accepted but is still being processed. Please try again in some time.\n\n  > HTTP `200 OK` - Matrix request successfully processed. The response body contains all of the results."

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview)  Flows. When paired with [Azure Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure Role based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Note\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* The Azure role based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."

  description: This is a shared key which is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs. With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.  For publicly exposed applications our recommendation is to use server to server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be  securely stored.
