  Returns  a route between an origin and a destination, passing through waypoints if they are specified. The route will take into account factors such as current traffic and the typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.


  Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry. Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available, depending on the options selected.


  Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of a vehicle-specific Consumption Model. Please check [Consumption Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model) for detailed explanation of the concepts and parameters involved.

    All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt. Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
      - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
        (or very near) the input reference route.
        - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
        - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
          of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
          vehicle position on the reference route).
      - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
        Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
        Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
        point will be excluded from the Response.
      - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
        how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
        route from the origin point onwards.
      - The route must use _departAt_.
      - The _vehicleHeading_ is ignored.

The value of batteryConsumptionInkWh includes the recuperated electric energy and can therefore be negative (which indicates gaining energy). If both maxChargeInkWh and currentChargeInkWh are specified, recuperation will be capped to ensure that the battery charge level never exceeds maxChargeInkWh. If neither maxChargeInkWh nor currentChargeInkWh are specified, unconstrained recuperation is assumed in the consumption calculation.

When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0 or v2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) supports Work, School, and Guests but does not support Personal accounts."

    This is a shared key that is provisioned when you [Create an Azure Maps account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/quick-demo-map-app#create-an-azure-maps-account) in the Azure portal or using PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST API.

     With this key, any application can access all REST API. In other words, this key can be used as a master key in the account that they are issued in.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to use the [confidential client applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/authentication-best-practices#confidential-client-applications) approach to access Azure Maps REST APIs so your key can be securely stored.

    This is a shared access signature token is created from the List SAS operation on the [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this token, any application is authorized to access with Azure role-based access controls and fine-grain control to the expiration, rate, and region(s) of use for the particular token. In other words, the SAS Token can be used to allow applications to control access in a more secured way than the shared key.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to configure a specific list of allowed origins on the [Map account resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) to limit rendering abuse and regularly renew the SAS Token.
