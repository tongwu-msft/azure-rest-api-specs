  Returns  a route between an origin and a destination, passing through waypoints if they are specified. The route will take into account factors such as current traffic and the typical road speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.


  Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a representation of the route geometry. Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint order or turn by turn instructions is also available, depending on the options selected.


  Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of vehicle-specific Consumption Model. Please check [Consumption Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/consumption-model) for detailed explanation of the concepts and parameters involved.

    All alternative routes returned will follow the reference route (see section POST Requests) from the origin point of the calculateRoute request for at least this number of seconds. Can only be used when reconstructing a route. The minDeviationTime parameter cannot be used in conjunction with arriveAt. Default value is 0. Setting )minDeviationTime_ to a value greater than zero has the following consequences:
      - The origin point of the _calculateRoute_ Request must be on
        (or very near) the input reference route.
        - If this is not the case, an error is returned.
        - However, the origin point does not need to be at the beginning
          of the input reference route (it can be thought of as the current
          vehicle position on the reference route).
      - The reference route, returned as the first route in the _calculateRoute_
        Response, will start at the origin point specified in the _calculateRoute_
        Request. The initial part of the input reference route up until the origin
        point will be excluded from the Response.
      - The values of _minDeviationDistance_ and _minDeviationTime_ determine
        how far alternative routes will be guaranteed to follow the reference
        route from the origin point onwards.
      - The route must use _departAt_.
      - The _vehicleHeading_ is ignored.

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview)  Flows. When paired with [Azure Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure Role based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Note\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* The Azure role based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."

  description: This is a shared key which is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs. With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.  For publicly exposed applications our recommendation is to use server to server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be  securely stored.
