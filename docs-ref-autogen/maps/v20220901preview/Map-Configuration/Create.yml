summary: "**Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).\n\nCreator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps API and SDK. [This](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/creator-indoor-maps) article introduces concepts and tools that apply to Azure Maps Creator.\n\nThe Map Configuration Create API allows the caller to create a map configuration from their map configuration file.\n\n## Submit Create Request\n\nTo create your map configuration you will make a `POST` request with a map configuration file. \n\n### POST Body for Create Request\nTo send the _create map configuration_ request you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain a `json` or `zip` file. If `json` file is provided, the request body will contain a map configuration file in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`, and if `zip` file is provided, the request body will contain a `zip` file including the map configuration json file and thumbnail images referenced in the configuration json file and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/zip`. Note: `json` file size limit is 1 MB and `zip` file size limit is 23 MB. Here's a sample map configuration json, refer to [map configuration specification](/rest/api/documentation-preview/map-configuration/create?#mapconfiguration) for more details:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 1.0,\n  \"description\": \"First indoor map configuration!\",\n  \"defaultStyle\": \"indoor_light\",\n  \"styles\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"indoor_light\",\n      \"displayName\": \"Indoor light\",\n      \"theme\": \"light\",\n      \"thumbnail\": \"indoor_2022-01-01.png\",\n      \"baseMap\": \"microsoft_light\",\n      \"layers\": [\n        {\n         \"tilesetId\": \"9601b149-cff6-dae6-af94-396f1b795fdb\",\n         \"styleId\": \"microsoft-maps:indoor_2022-01-01\"\n        }\n       ] \n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"indoor_dark\",\n      \"displayName\": \"Indoor dark\",\n      \"theme\": \"dark\",\n      \"baseMap\": \"microsoft_dark\",\n      \"thumbnail\": \"indoor_dark_2022-01-01.png\",\n      \"layers\": [\n        {\n          \"tilesetId\": \"9601b149-cff6-dae6-af94-396f1b795fdb\",\n          \"styleId\": \"microsoft-maps:indoor_dark_2022-01-01\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```     \n\n Since the map configuration json contains two thumbnail image references 'indoor_2022-01-01.png' and 'indoor_dark_2022-01-01.png', a zip file including the map configuration json file and two thumbnail images should be provided as request body to make a valid create request. \n\nThe Create Map Configuration API is a [long-running request](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2)."

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview) Flows. When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0 or v2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) supports Work, School, and Guests but does not support Personal accounts."

     With this key, any application can access all REST API. In other words, this key can be used as a master key in the account that they are issued in.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to use the [confidential client applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/authentication-best-practices#confidential-client-applications) approach to access Azure Maps REST APIs so your key can be securely stored.

In other words, the SAS Token can be used to allow applications to control access in a more secured way than the shared key.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to configure a specific list of allowed origins on the [Map account resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) to limit rendering abuse and regularly renew the SAS Token.
