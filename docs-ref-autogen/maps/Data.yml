  summary: "**Data Update API**\n\n**Applies to:** S1 pricing tier.\n\nThe Data Update API allows the caller to update a previously uploaded data content.\n\nYou can use this API in a scenario like adding or removing geofences to or from an existing collection of geofences. \nGeofences are uploaded using the [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/uploadpreview), for \nuse in the [Azure Maps Geofencing Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/spatial).\n\nPlease note that the Update API will *replace* and *override* the existing data content.\n\n## Submit Update Request\n\nTo update your content you will use a `PUT` request. The request body will contain the new data that will replace \nthe existing data. The `Content-Type` header will be set to the content type of the data, and the path will contain \nthe `udid` of the data to be update.\n\nFor example, to update a collection of geofences that were previously uploaded using the Upload API, place the new \ngeofence content in the request body. Set the `udid` parameter in the path to the `udid` of the data received \npreviously in the upload API response. And set the `Content-Type` header to one of the following media types:\n\n- `application/json`\n- `application/vnd.geo+json`\n- `application/octet-stream`\n\nHere's a sample request body for updating a simple Geofence. It's represented as a circle geometry using a center \npoint and a radius. The sample below is in `GeoJSON`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n    \"features\": [{\n        \"type\": \"Feature\",\n        \"geometry\": {\n            \"type\": \"Point\",\n            \"coordinates\": [-122.126986, 47.639754]\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"geometryId\": \"001\",\n            \"radius\": 500\n        }\n    }]\n}\n```\n\nThe previously uploaded geofence had a radius of 100m. The above request will update it to 500m.\n\nThe Data Update API performs a \n[long-running request](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/private-atlas-long-running-operation).\n\n## Data Update Limits\n\nPlease, be aware that currently every Azure Maps account has a [data storage limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-maps-limits). \nOnce the storage limit is reached, all the new upload API calls will return a `409 Conflict` http error response. \nYou can always use the [Data Delete API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/deletepreview) to \ndelete old/unused content and create space for new uploads."

  summary: "**Data Upload API**\n\n**Applies to:** S1 pricing tier.\n\nThe Data Upload API allows the caller to upload data content to the Azure Maps service.\nYou can use this API in a scenario like uploading a collection of Geofences in `GeoJSON` \nformat, for use in our [Azure Maps Geofencing Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/spatial).\n\n## Submit Upload Request\n\nTo upload your content you will use a `POST` request. The request body will contain the data to upload. The \n`dataFormat` query parameter will contain the format for the data, the `dataSharingLevel` query parameter \ncan contain the sharing level for the data. The `Content-Type` header will be set to the content type of the \ndata.\n\nFor example, to upload a collection of geofences  in `GeoJSON` format, set the request body to the geofence \ncontent.
