  summary: "**Conversion Create API**\n\n**Applies to:** S1 pricing tier.<br>\n\nCreator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps API and \nSDK. The Conversion API is part of Creator.<br>\n\nThe Conversion API lets the caller import a set of DWG design files as a zipped [Drawing Package](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-package) into Azure Maps. The DWG files should first be \nuploaded using the [Azure Maps Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data). Once uploaded, use the \n`udid` returned by the [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/uploadpreview) to call \nthis Conversion API.\n\n## Convert DWG package\n\nThe Conversion API performs a \n[long-running request](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt).\n\n## Debug DWG package issues\n\n\nDuring the Conversion process, if there are any issues with the DWG package [errors and warnings](https://aka.ms/am-conversion-errors) are provided in the response along with a *diagnostic package* to visualize \nand diagnose these issues. In case any issues are encountered with your DWG package, the Conversion operation status process as detailed \n[here](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt) returns the location of the *diagnostic\npackage* that can be downloaded by the caller to help them visualize and diagnose these issues. The *diagnostic package* location\ncan be found in the properties section of the conversion operation status response and looks like the following:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"diagnosticPackageLocation\": \"https://atlas.microsoft.com/mapdata/{DiagnosticPackageId}?api-version=1.0\"                \n    }            \n}\n```\n\nThe *diagnostic package* can be downloaded by executing a `HTTP GET` request on the `diagnosticPackageLocation`.\nFor more details on how to use the tool to visualize and diagnose all the errors and warnings [see](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-errors-visualizer). <br>\n\nA conversion operation will be marked as *success* if there are zero or more warnings but will be marked as *failed* if any errors are encountered.

  summary: "**Conversion Delete API**\n\n**Applies to:** S1 pricing tier.<br>\n\nCreator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps API and SDK. The Delete API is part of Creator.<br>\n\nThis API allows the caller to delete any data conversions created previously using the [Conversion API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/conversion/convertpreview).\n\n### Submit Delete Request\n\nTo delete your conversion data you will issue a `DELETE` request where the path will contain the `conversionId` of the data to delete.\n\n### Conversion Delete Response\n\nThe Conversion Delete API returns a HTTP `204 No Content` response with an empty body, if the converted data resources were deleted successfully.<br>    \nA HTTP `400 Bad Request` error response will be returned if no resource associated with the passed-in `conversionId` is found.

  summary: "**Conversion List API**\n\n**Applies to:** S1 pricing tier.<br>\n\nCreator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps API and SDK. The Conversion API is part of Creator.<br>\n\nThis API allows the caller to fetch a list of all successful data conversions submitted previously using the [Conversion API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/conversion/convertpreview).   \n\n### Submit List Request\n\nTo list all successful conversions you will issue a `GET` request with no additional parameters.\n\n### List Data Response\n\nThe Conversion List API returns the complete list of all conversion details in `json` format.<br>\n\nHere is a sample response returning the details of two successful conversion requests:  \n\n<br>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"conversions\": \n    [\n        {\n            \"conversionId\": \"54398242-ea6c-1f31-4fa6-79b1ae0fc24d\",\n            \"udid\": \"31838736-8b84-11ea-bc55-0242ac130003\",\n            \"created\": \"5/19/2020 9:00:00 AM +00:00\",\n            \"description\": \"User provided description.\",\n            \"featureCounts\": {\n                \"DIR\": 1,\n                \"LVL\": 3,\n                \"FCL\": 1,\n                \"UNIT\": 150,\n                \"CTG\": 8,\n                \"AEL\": 0,\n                \"OPN\": 10\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"conversionId\": \"2acf7d32-8b84-11ea-bc55-0242ac130003\",\n            \"udid\": \"1214bc58-8b84-11ea-bc55-0242ac1300039\",\n            \"created\": \"5/19/2020 9:00:00 AM +00:00\",\n            \"description\": \"User provided description.\",\n            \"featureCounts\": {\n                \"DIR\": 1,\n                \"LVL\": 3,\n                \"FCL\": 1,\n                \"UNIT\": 150,\n                \"CTG\": 8,\n                \"AEL\": 0,\n                \"OPN\": 10\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n<br>"
