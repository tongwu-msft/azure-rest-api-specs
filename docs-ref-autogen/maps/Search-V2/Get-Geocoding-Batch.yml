  **Geocoding Batch API**



  **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).




  The Geocoding Batch API sends batches of queries to [Geocoding API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-geocoding) using just a single API call. The API allows caller to batch up to **100** queries.

  >[!Important]

  >By using this feature, you agree to the preview legal terms. See the [Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional details.


  ### Submit Synchronous Batch Request

  The Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight batch requests. When the service receives a request, it will respond as soon as the batch items are calculated and there will be no possibility to retrieve the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a 408 response) if the request takes longer than 60 seconds. The number of batch items is limited to **100** for this API.

  ```

  POST https://atlas.microsoft.com/geocode/batch?api-version=2021-11-01-preview

  ```

  ### POST Body for Batch Request

  To send the _geocoding_ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain the `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Here's a sample request body containing 2 _geocoding_ queries:



  ```

  {
    "batchItems": [
      {
        "addressLine": "One, Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052",
        "top": 2
      },
      {
        "addressLine": "Pike Pl",
        "adminDistrict": "WA",
        "locality": "Seattle",
        "top": 3
      }
    ]
  }

  ```


  A _geocoding_ batchItem object can accept any of the supported _geocoding_ [URI parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-geocoding#uri-parameters).



  The batch should contain at least **1** query.



  ### Batch Response Model

  The batch response contains a `summary` component that indicates the `totalRequests` that were part of the original batch request and `successfulRequests` i.e. queries which were executed successfully. The batch response also includes a `batchItems` array which contains a response for each and every query in the batch request. The `batchItems` will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were sent in the batch request. Each item is of one of the following types:

    - [`GeocodingResponse`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/search-v2/get-geocoding#geocodingresponse) - If the query completed successfully.

    - `Error` - If the query failed. The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case.

    description: >-
      The level of confidence that the geocoded location result is a match. Use this value with the match code to determine for more complete information about the match.


      The confidence of a geocoded location is based on many factors including the relative importance of the geocoded location and the userâ€™s location, if specified. The following description provides more information about how confidence scores are assigned and how results are ranked.


      If the confidence is set to `High`, one or more strong matches were found. Multiple `High` confidence matches are sorted in ranked order by importance when applicable. For example, landmarks have importance but addresses do not.


      If a request includes a user location or a map area (see User Context Parameters), then the ranking may change appropriately. For example, a location query for "Paris" returns "Paris, France" and "Paris, TX" both with `High` confidence. "Paris, France" is always ranked first due to importance unless a user location indicates that the user is in or very close to Paris, TX or the map view indicates that the user is searching in that area.


      In some situations, the returned match may not be at the same level as the information provided in the request. For example, a request may specify address information and the geocode service may only be able to match a postal code. In this case, if the geocode service has a confidence that the postal code matches the data, the confidence is set to `Medium` and the match code is set to `UpHierarchy` to specify that it could not match all of the information and had to search up-hierarchy.


      If the location information in the query is ambiguous, and there is no additional information to rank the locations (such as user location or the relative importance of the location), the confidence is set to `Medium`. For example, a location query for "148th Ave, Bellevue" may return "148th Ave SE" and "148th Ave NE" both with `Medium` confidence.


      If the location information in the query does not provide enough information to geocode a specific location, a less precise location value may be returned and the confidence is set to `Medium`. For example, if an address is provided, but a match is not found for the house number, the geocode result with a Roadblock entity type may be returned.
    types:
    - uid: Confidence
  - name: matchCodes
    description: >-
      One or more match code values that represent the geocoding level for each location in the response.


      For example, a geocoded location with match codes of `Good` and `Ambiguous` means that more than one geocode location was found for the location information and that the geocode service did not have search up-hierarchy to find a match.


      Similarly, a geocoded location with match codes of `Ambiguous` and `UpHierarchy` implies that a geocode location could not be found that matched all the provided location information, so the geocode service had to search up-hierarchy and found multiple matches at that level. An example of up an `Ambiguous` and `UpHierarchy` result is when you provide complete address information, but the geocode service cannot locate a match for the street address and instead returns information for more than one RoadBlock value.


      The possible values are:


      `Good`: The location has only one match or all returned matches are considered strong matches. For example, a query for New York returns several Good matches.


      `Ambiguous`: The location is one of a set of possible matches. For example, when you query for the street address 128 Main St., the response may return two locations for 128 North Main St. and 128 South Main St. because there is not enough information to determine which option to choose.


      `UpHierarchy`: The location represents a move up the geographic hierarchy. This occurs when a match for the location request was not found, so a less precise result is returned. For example, if a match for the requested address cannot be found, then a match code of `UpHierarchy` with a RoadBlock entity type may be returned.

When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."

    This is a shared key that is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to use server-to-server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be  securely stored.
