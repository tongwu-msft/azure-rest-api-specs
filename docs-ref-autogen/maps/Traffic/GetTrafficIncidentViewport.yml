summary: __Traffic Incident Viewport__ <br/><br/>This API returns legal and technical information for the viewport described in the request. It should be called by client applications whenever the viewport changes (for instance, through zooming, panning, going to a location, or displaying a route). The request should contain the bounding box and zoom level of the viewport whose information is needed. The return will contain map version information, as well as the current Traffic Model ID and copyright IDs. The Traffic Model ID returned by the Viewport Description is used by other APIs to retrieve last traffic information for further processing.

  description: "Bounding box of the map viewport in [EPSG900913](http://docs.openlayers.org/library/spherical_mercator.html) projection. The `boundingbox` is represented by two value pairs describing it's corners (first pair for lower left corner and second for upper right). All values should be separated by commas (e.g., _minY,minX,maxY,maxX_). The maximum size of the bounding box that can be passed is dependent on the requested zoom level. The width and height cannot exceed 4092 pixels when rendered on the given zoom level.<br><br>NOTE: Bounding boxes that cross the 180° meridian require special treatment. For such boxes, the eastern _maxX_ value will be negative, and thus less than the _minX_ value west of the 180° meridian. To address that, the value 40075016.6855874 should be added to the true _maxX_ value before it is passed in the request."
