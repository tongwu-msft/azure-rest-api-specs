  __Traffic Incident Viewport__



  **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).


  This API returns legal and technical information for the viewport described in the request. It should be called  by client applications whenever the viewport changes (for instance, through zooming, panning, going to a  location, or displaying a route). The request should contain the bounding box and zoom level of the viewport  whose information is needed. The return will contain map version information, as well as the current Traffic  Model ID and copyright IDs. The Traffic Model ID returned by the Viewport Description is used by other APIs to  retrieve last traffic information for further processing.

  description: "Bounding box of the map viewport in [EPSG900913](http://docs.openlayers.org/library/spherical_mercator.html) projection. The `boundingbox` is represented by two value pairs describing it's corners (first pair for lower left corner and second for upper right). When this endpoint is called directly, all values should be separated by commas (e.g., _minY,minX,maxY,maxX_). The maximum size of the bounding box that can be passed is dependent on the requested zoom level. The width and height cannot exceed 4092 pixels when rendered on the given zoom level.<br><br>NOTE: Bounding boxes that cross the 180° meridian require special treatment. For such boxes, the eastern _maxX_ value will be negative, and thus less than the _minX_ value west of the 180° meridian. To address that, the value 40075016.6855874 should be added to the true _maxX_ value before it is passed in the request."

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview) Flows. When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0 or v2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) supports Work, School, and Guests but does not support Personal accounts."

    This is a shared key that is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to use server-to-server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be securely stored.

    This is a shared access signature token is created from the List SAS operation on the [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this token, any application is authorized to access with Azure role-based access controls and fine-grain control to the expiration, rate, and region(s) of use for the particular token. In other words, the SAS Token can be used to allow applications to control access in a more secured way than the shared key.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to configure a specific list of allowed origins on the [Map account resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) to limit rendering abuse and regularly renew the SAS Token.
