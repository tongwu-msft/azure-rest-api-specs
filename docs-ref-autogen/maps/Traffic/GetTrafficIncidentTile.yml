summary: __Traffic Incident Tile__ <br/><br/>This API provides information on traffic incidents inside a given bounding box, based on the current Traffic Model ID. The Traffic Model ID is available to grant synchronization of data between calls and API's. The Traffic Model ID is a key value for determining the currency of traffic incidents. It is updated every minute, and is valid for two minutes before it times out. It is used in rendering [traffic tiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/location-based-services/traffic/gettrafficincidenttile). It can be obtained from the [Viewport API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/location-based-services/traffic/gettrafficincidentviewport).
