  **Get Daily Indices**


  **Applies to**: S0 and S1 pricing tiers.


  There may be times when you want to know if the weather conditions are optimal for a specific activity, for example, for outdoor construction, indoor activities, running or farming including soil moisture information.  Azure Maps Indices API returns index values that will guide end users to plan future activities. For example, a health mobile application can notify users that today is good weather for running or for other outdoors activities like for playing golf, and retail stores can optimize their digital marketing campaigns based on predicted index values. The service returns in daily indices values for current and next 5, 10 and 15 days starting from current day.
