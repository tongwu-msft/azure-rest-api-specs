summary: "**Get Weather along route**\n   \n   \n **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).\n\n Weather along a route API returns hyper local (one kilometer or less), up-to-the-minute weather nowcasts, weather hazard assessments, and notifications along a route described as a sequence of waypoints. \n This includes a list of weather hazards affecting the waypoint or route, and the aggregated hazard index for each waypoint might be used to paint each portion of a route according to how safe it is for the driver. When submitting the waypoints, it is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or shortly after. Data is updated every five minutes. \n \n The service supplements Azure Maps [Route Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route) that allows you to first request a route between an origin and a destination and use that as an input for Weather Along Route endpoint.\n \n In addition, the service supports scenarios to generate weather notifications for waypoints that experience an increase in intensity of a weather hazard. For example, if the vehicle is expected to begin experiencing heavy rain as it reaches a waypoint, a weather notification for heavy rain will be generated for that waypoint allowing the end product to display a heavy rain notification before the driver reaches that waypoint. \n The trigger for when to display the notification for a waypoint could be based, for example, on a [geofence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/tutorial-iot-hub-maps), or selectable distance to the waypoint.\n\n The API covers all regions of the planet except latitudes above Greenland and Antarctica."

  description: "Coordinates through which the route is calculated, separated by colon (:) and entered in chronological order. A minimum of two waypoints is required. A single API call may contain up to 60 waypoints. \nA waypoint indicates location, ETA, and optional heading: latitude,longitude,ETA,heading, where\n  * `Latitude` - Latitude coordinate in decimal degrees.\n  * `Longitude` - Longitude coordinate in decimal degrees.\n  * `ETA (estimated time of arrival)` - The number of minutes from the present time that it will take for the vehicle to reach the waypoint. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 120.0 minutes.\n  * `Heading` - An optional value indicating the vehicle heading as it passes the waypoint. Expressed in clockwise degrees relative to true north. This is issued to calculate sun glare as a driving hazard. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 360.0 degrees. If not provided, a heading will automatically be derived based on the position of neighboring waypoints.\n\nIt is recommended to stay within, or close to, the distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or shortly after. This way a more accurate assessment can be provided for the trip and prevent isolated events not being captured between waypoints.  Information can and should be updated along the route (especially for trips greater than 2 hours) to continuously pull new waypoints moving forward, but also to ensure that forecast information for content such as precipitation type and intensity is accurate as storms develop and dissipate over time."

When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0 or v2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) supports Work, School, and Guests but does not support Personal accounts."

    This is a shared key that is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to use server-to-server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be securely stored.

    This is a shared access signature token is created from the List SAS operation on the [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this token, any application is authorized to access with Azure role-based access controls and fine-grain control to the expiration, rate, and region(s) of use for the particular token. In other words, the SAS Token can be used to allow applications to control access in a more secured way than the shared key.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to configure a specific list of allowed origins on the [Map account resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) to limit rendering abuse and regularly renew the SAS Token.
