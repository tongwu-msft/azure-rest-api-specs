  **Get Severe Weather Alerts**


  **Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).


  Severe weather phenomenon can significantly impact our everyday life and business operations. For example, severe weather conditions such as tropical storms, high winds or flooding can close roads and force logistics companies to reroute their fleet causing delays in reaching destinations and breaking the cold chain of refrigerated food products.  Azure Maps Severe Weather Alerts API returns the severe weather alerts that are available worldwide from both official Government Meteorological Agencies and leading global to regional weather alert providers. The service can return details such as alert type, category, level and detailed description about the active severe alerts for the requested location, like hurricanes, thunderstorms, lightning, heat waves or forest fires.

In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance.
