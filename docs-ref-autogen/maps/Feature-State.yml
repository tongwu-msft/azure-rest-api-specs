The Feature State API is part of Creator. \n\nThe Feature State service allows the user to update the states of a feature and query them to be used in other services. The dynamic properties of a feature that don't belong to the dataset are referred to as *states* here.\n\nThis Feature State service pivot on the Stateset. Like Tileset, Stateset encapsulates the storage mechanism for feature states for a dataset.\n\nOnce the stateset is created, users can use that statesetId to post feature state updates and retrieve the current feature states. A feature can have only one state at a given point in time. \n\nFeature state is defined by the key name, value and the timestamp. When a feature state update is posted to Azure Maps, the state value gets updated only if the provided stateâ€™s timestamp is later than the stored timestamp. \n\nAzure Maps MapControl provides a way to use these feature states to style the features. Please refer to the State Tile documentation for more information."
