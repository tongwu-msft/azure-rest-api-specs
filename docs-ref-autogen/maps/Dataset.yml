    <br>


    Creator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps API and SDK. The Dataset APIs are part of Creator.

    This API allows the caller to fetch a list of all previously successfully created datasets.



    ### Submit List Request


    To list all your datasets, you will issue a `GET` request with no additional parameters.<br>



    ### List Data Response


    The List API returns the complete list of all datasets in `json` format. The response contains the following fields (if they are not null or empty):
      > created - The timestamp the dataset was created.
      > datasetId - The id for the dataset.
      > description - The description for the dataset.
      > datasetSources - The source data that was used when the create request was issued.

    The `datasetSources` describes the source data that was used when the create request was issued and contains the following elements (if they are not null or empty):
      > conversionIds - The list of `conversionId` (null if none were provided).
      > udids - The list of `udid` (null if none were provided).
      > appendDatasetId - The `datasetId` that was used for an append operation (null if none was used).
      > type - The type of data stored in the dataset that was created.

    Here's a sample response returning the `timestamp`, `datasetId`, `description`, and `datasetSources` of 3 dataset resources:
