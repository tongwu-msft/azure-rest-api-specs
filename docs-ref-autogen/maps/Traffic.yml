- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.traffic.gettrafficflowsegment
  summary: __Traffic Flow Segment__<br/><br/>This service provides information about the speeds and travel times of the road fragment closest to the given coordinates. It is designed to work alongside the Flow layer of the Render Service to support clickable flow data visualizations. With this API, the client side can connect any place in the map with flow data on the closest road and present it to the user.
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.traffic.gettrafficflowtile
  summary: __Traffic Flow Tile__ <br/><br/>The Azure Flow Tile API serves 256 x 256 pixel tiles showing traffic flow. All tiles use the same grid system. Because the traffic tiles use transparent images, they can be layered on top of map tiles to create a compound display. The Flow tiles use colors to indicate either the speed of traffic on different road segments, or the difference between that speed and the free-flow speed on the road segment in question.
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.traffic.gettrafficincidentdetail
  summary: "__Traffic Incident Detail__ \nThis API provides information on traffic incidents inside a given bounding box, based on the current Traffic Model ID. The Traffic Model ID is available to grant synchronization of data between calls and API's. The Traffic Model ID is a key value for determining the currency of traffic incidents. It is updated every minute,  and is valid for two minutes before it times out.  It is used in rendering [incident tiles](../traffic/gettrafficincidenttile). It can be obtained from the [Viewport API](../traffic/gettrafficincidentviewport)."

- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.traffic.gettrafficincidentviewport
  summary: __Traffic Incident Viewport__ <br/><br/>This API returns legal and technical information for the viewport described in the request. It should be called by client applications whenever the viewport changes (for instance, through zooming, panning, going to a location, or displaying a route). The request should contain the bounding box and zoom level of the viewport whose information is needed. The return will contain map version information, as well as the current Traffic Model ID and copyright IDs. The Traffic Model ID returned by the Viewport Description is used by other APIs to retrieve last traffic information for further processing.
