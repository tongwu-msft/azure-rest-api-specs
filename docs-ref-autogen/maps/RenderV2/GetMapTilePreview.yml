  Get Map Tiles API allows users to request map tiles in vector or raster format typically to be integrated into a map control or SDK. The service allows to request various map tiles, such as Azure Maps road tiles or real-time Weather Radar tiles. By default, Azure Maps uses vector map tiles for its web map control (Web SDK) and Android SDK.

    The View parameter specifies which set of geopolitically disputed content is returned via Azure Maps services, including  borders and labels displayed on the map. The View parameter (also referred to as “user region parameter”) will show the  correct maps for that country/region. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t defined it in  the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of your users, and then set the View parameter correctly  for that location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws, including those  regarding mapping, of the country where maps, images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to  access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview)  Flows. When paired with [Azure Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure Role based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Note\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* The Azure role based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."
