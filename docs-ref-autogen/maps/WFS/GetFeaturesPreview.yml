summary: "Creator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor  map data using Azure Maps API and SDK. The Web Feature Service (WFS) API is part of  Creator. WFS API follows the [Open Geospatial Consortium API standard for Features](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html) to query [Datasets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/dataset/createpreview). \nA dataset consists of multiple feature collections. A feature collection is a collection of features of a similar type, based on a common schema.\nThe Get Features API returns the list of features in the given collection."

  description: >-
    The optional limit parameter limits the number of features that are presented in the response document.

    Only features that are on the first level of the collection in the response document are counted. Nested objects contained within the explicitly requested features shall not be counted.

    * Minimum = 1 * Maximum = 50 * Default = 10
  types:
  - uid: number
- name: bbox
  in: query
  description: >-
    Only features that have a geometry that intersects the supplied bounding box are selected.

    * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1 * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2 * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1 * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2

    The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.

    For WGS84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude. However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).
  types:
  - uid: string
- name: filter
  in: query
  description: >-
    Filter expression to search for features with specific property values in a given collection. Only feature properties of scalar type and equals operator are supported.

    This is a special parameter where the parameter name is the property name. The scheme for this parameter is {property name}={property value}. Unless "filter" is one of the property names in the collection, "filter" should not be used as a parameter name. To search for features with "name" property value "21N13", use "name=21N13".

    Multiple filters are supported and should be represented as multiple query parameters. E.g., <property1>=<value1>&<property2>=<value2> String values are case sensitive.

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview)  Flows. When paired with [Azure Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure Role based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Note\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* The Azure role based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."

For publicly exposed applications our recommendation is to use server to server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be  securely stored.
