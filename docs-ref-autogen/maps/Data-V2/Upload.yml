summary: "**Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).\n\nThe Data Upload API allows the caller to upload data content to the Azure Maps service.\nYou can use this API in a scenario like uploading a collection of Geofences in `GeoJSON` \nformat, for use in our [Azure Maps Geofencing Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/spatial).\n\n>[!Important]\n>By using this feature, you agree to the preview legal terms. See the [Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for additional details.\n## Submit Upload Request\n\nTo upload your content you will use a `POST` request. The request body will contain the data to upload. The \n`dataFormat` query parameter will contain the format for the data, the `dataSharingLevel` query parameter \ncan contain the sharing level for the data. The `Content-Type` header will be set to the content type of the \ndata.\n\nFor example, to upload a collection of geofences  in `GeoJSON` format, set the request body to the geofence \ncontent. Set the `dataFormat` query parameter to _geojson_, and set the `Content-Type` header to either one \nof the following media types:\n\n- `application/json`\n- `application/vnd.geo+json`\n- `application/octet-stream`\n\nHere's a sample request body for uploading a simple Geofence represented as a circle geometry using a center \npoint and a radius. The sample below is in `GeoJSON`:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n    \"features\": [{\n        \"type\": \"Feature\",\n        \"geometry\": {\n            \"type\": \"Point\",\n            \"coordinates\": [-122.126986, 47.639754]\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"geometryId\": \"001\",\n            \"radius\": 500\n        }\n    }]\n}\n```\n\nThe Data Upload API performs a \n[long-running request](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2).\n\n## Data Upload Limits\n\nPlease, be aware that currently every Azure Maps account has a [data storage limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-maps-limits). \nOnce the storage limit is reached, all the new upload API calls will return a `409 Conflict` http error response. \nYou can always use the [Data Delete API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data-v2/delete-preview) to \ndelete old/unused content and create space for new uploads."

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview) Flows. When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0 or v2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) supports Work, School, and Guests but does not support Personal accounts."

    This is a shared key that is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to use server-to-server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be securely stored.

     With this token, any application is authorized to access with Azure role-based access controls and fine-grain control to the expiration, rate, and region(s) of use for the particular token. In other words, the SAS Token can be used to allow applications to control access in a more secured way than the shared key.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to configure a specific list of allowed origins on the [Map account resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) to limit rendering abuse and regularly renew the SAS Token.
