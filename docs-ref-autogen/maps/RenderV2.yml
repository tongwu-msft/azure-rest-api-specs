    The Get Map Tiles API allows users to request map tiles in vector or raster formats typically to be integrated  into a map control or SDK. Some example tiles that can be requested are Azure Maps road tiles, real-time  Weather Radar tiles or the map tiles created using [Azure Maps Creator](https://aka.ms/amcreator). By default,  Azure Maps uses vector tiles for its web map control (Web SDK) and Android SDK.
