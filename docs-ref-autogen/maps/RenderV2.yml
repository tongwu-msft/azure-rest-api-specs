    Get Map Tiles API allows users to request map tiles in vector or raster format typically to be integrated into a map control or SDK. The service allows to request various map tiles, such as Azure Maps road tiles or real-time Weather Radar tiles. By default, Azure Maps uses vector map tiles for its web map control (Web SDK) and Android SDK.
