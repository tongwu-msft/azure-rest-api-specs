summary: "**Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).\n\nThis API allows the caller to download a previously uploaded data content.<br>    \nYou can use this API in a scenario like downloading an existing collection of geofences uploaded previously using the [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data%20v2/uploadpreview) for use in our [Azure Maps Geofencing Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/spatial). \n\n\n### Submit Download Request\n\nTo download your content you will use a `GET` request where the path will contain the `udid` of the data to download. Optionally, you can also pass in an `Accept` header to specify a preference for the `Content-Type` of the data response. <br>\nFor example, to download a collection of geofences previously uploaded using the Upload API, set the `udid` parameter in the path to the `udid` of the data received previously in the upload API response and set the `Accept` header to either one of the following media types: \n    \n  - `application/json`\n  - `application/vnd.geo+json`\n  - `application/octet-stream`\n\n\n### Download Data Response\n\nThe Download API will return a HTTP `200 OK` response if the data resource with the passed-in `udid` is found, where the response body will contain the content of the data resource.<br>\nA HTTP `400 Bad Request` error response will be returned if the data resource with the passed-in `udid` is not found.<br>\n\nHere's a sample response body for a simple geofence represented in `GeoJSON` uploaded previously using the Upload API:\n<br>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n    \"features\": [{\n        \"type\": \"Feature\",\n        \"geometry\": {\n            \"type\": \"Point\",\n            \"coordinates\": [-122.126986, 47.639754]\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"geometryId\": \"001\",\n            \"radius\": 500\n        }\n    }]\n}\n```"

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview)  Flows. When paired with [Azure Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure Role based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Note\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* The Azure role based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."

  description: This is a shared key which is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs. With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.  For publicly exposed applications our recommendation is to use server to server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be  securely stored.
