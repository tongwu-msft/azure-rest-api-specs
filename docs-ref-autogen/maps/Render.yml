    Copyrights API is designed to serve copyright information for Render Tile  service. In addition to basic copyright for the whole map, API is serving  specific groups of copyrights for some countries.


    As an alternative to copyrights for map request, one can receive captions  for displaying the map provider information on the map.

    Returns the copyright information for a given tile. To obtain the  copyright information for a particular tile, the request should specify  the tile's zoom level and x and y coordinates (see: Zoom Levels and Tile  Grid).

    The static image service renders a user-defined, rectangular image containing a map section using a zoom level from 0 to 20.


    The supported resolution range for the map image is from 1x1 to 8192x8192.


    If you are deciding when to use the static image service over the map tile service, you may want to consider how you would like to interact with the rendered map. If the map contents will be relatively unchanging, a static map is a good choice. If you want to support a lot of zooming, panning and changing of the map content, the map tile service would be a better choice.


    _Note_ : Either **center** or **bbox** parameter must be supplied to the API.

    The supported Lat and Lon ranges when using the **bbox** parameter, are as follows:

    Zoom Level | Max Lon Range | Max Lat Range

    -----------|---------------|--------------

    0 | 360.0 | 170.0

    1 | 360.0 | 170.0

  summary: This service returns a map image tile with size 256x256, given the x and y coordinates and zoom level. Zoom level ranges from 0 to 18. The current available style value is 'satellite' which provides satellite imagery alone.
- uid: atlas.microsoft.com.maps.render.getmaptile
  summary: Fetches map tiles in vector or raster format typically to be integrated into a new map control or SDK. By default, Azure uses vector map tiles for its web map control (see [Zoom Levels and Tile Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/location-based-services/zoom-levels-and-tile-grid))
