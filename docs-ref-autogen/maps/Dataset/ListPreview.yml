  **Dataset List API**


  **Applies to:** S1 pricing tier.

  <br>


  Creator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps API and SDK. The Dataset APIs are part of Creator.

  This API allows the caller to fetch a list of all previously successfully created datasets.



  ### Submit List Request


  To list all your datasets, you will issue a `GET` request with no additional parameters.<br>



  ### List Data Response


  The List API returns the complete list of all datasets in `json` format. The response contains the following fields (if they are not null or empty):
    > created - The timestamp the dataset was created.
    > datasetId - The id for the dataset.
    > description - The description for the dataset.
    > datasetSources - The source data that was used when the create request was issued.

  The `datasetSources` describes the source data that was used when the create request was issued and contains the following elements (if they are not null or empty):
    > conversionIds - The list of `conversionId` (null if none were provided).
    > udids - The list of `udid` (null if none were provided).
    > appendDatasetId - The `datasetId` that was used for an append operation (null if none was used).
    > type - The type of data stored in the dataset that was created.

  Here's a sample response returning the `timestamp`, `datasetId`, `description`, and `datasetSources` of 3 dataset resources:

When paired with [Azure Role Based Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)  control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure Role based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Note\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* The Azure role based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."
