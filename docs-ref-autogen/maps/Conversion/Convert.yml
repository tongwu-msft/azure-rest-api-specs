summary: "**Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).\n\nCreator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps API and SDK. [This](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/creator-indoor-maps) article introduces concepts and tools that apply to Azure Maps Creator.\n\nThe Conversion API lets the caller import a set of DWG design files as a zipped [Drawing Package](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-package) into Azure Maps. The [Drawing Package](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-package) should first be uploaded using the [Azure Maps Data Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data). Once uploaded, use the `udid` returned by the [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data-v2/upload-preview) to call this Conversion API.\n\n## Convert DWG package\n\nThe Conversion API performs a [long-running request](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2).\n\n## Debug DWG package issues\n\n\nDuring the Conversion process, if there are any issues with the DWG package [errors and warnings](https://aka.ms/am-conversion-errors) are provided in the response along with a *diagnostic package* to visualize and diagnose these issues. In case any issues are encountered with your DWG package, the Conversion operation status process as detailed [here](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2) returns the location of the *diagnostic package* that can be downloaded by the caller to help them visualize and diagnose these issues. The *diagnostic package* location can be found in the properties section of the conversion operation status response and looks like the following:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"diagnosticPackageLocation\": \"https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/mapdata/{DiagnosticPackageId}?api-version=1.0\"                \n    }            \n}\n```\n\nThe *diagnostic package* can be downloaded by executing a `HTTP GET` request on the `diagnosticPackageLocation`.\nFor more details on how to use the tool to visualize and diagnose all the errors and warnings see [Drawing Error Visualizer](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-errors-visualizer). <br>\n\nA conversion operation will be marked as *success* if there are zero or more warnings but will be marked as *failed* if any errors are encountered.

  description: "These are the [Azure Active Directory OAuth2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-overview) Flows. When paired with [Azure role-based access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) control it can be used to control access to Azure Maps REST APIs. Azure role-based access controls are used to designate access to one or more Azure Maps resource account or sub-resources. Any user, group, or service principal can be granted access via a  built-in role or a custom role composed of one or more permissions to Azure Maps REST APIs.\n\nTo implement scenarios, we recommend viewing [authentication concepts](https://aka.ms/amauth). In summary, this security definition provides a solution for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Notes\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to. This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* \nThe `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* \nThe Azure role-based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* \nUsage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently, Azure Active Directory [v1.0 or v2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) supports Work, School, and Guests but does not support Personal accounts."

    This is a shared key that is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to use server-to-server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be securely stored.

    This is a shared access signature token is created from the List SAS operation on the [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane via Azure portal, PowerShell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

     With this token, any application is authorized to access with Azure role-based access controls and fine-grain control to the expiration, rate, and region(s) of use for the particular token. In other words, the SAS Token can be used to allow applications to control access in a more secured way than the shared key.

     For publicly exposed applications, our recommendation is to configure a specific list of allowed origins on the [Map account resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) to limit rendering abuse and regularly renew the SAS Token.
