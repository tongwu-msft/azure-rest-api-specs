  **Search Geofence Post API**



  **Applies to:** S1 Pricing tier.


  The Geofence Post API allows you to retrieve the proximity of a coordinate to a  provided geofence or set of fences. With POST call, you do not have to upload the fence data in advance, instead you supply the location of the object you are tracking in query parameters as well as the fence or set of fences data in post request body. See [Geofencing GeoJSON data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/geofence-geojson) for more details on the geofence data format. The response will contain information about the distance from the outer edge of the geofence. A negative value signifies that the  coordinate is inside of the fence while a positive value means that it is outside of the fence.<br><br>This API can be used for a variety of scenarios that include things like asset  tracking, fleet management, or setting up alerts for moving objects.


  The API supports [integration with Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/azure-maps-event-grid-integration).  The isAsync parameter is used to enable integration with Event Grid (disabled by default).
