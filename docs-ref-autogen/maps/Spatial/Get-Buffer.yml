summary: "**Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.\n\nThis API returns a FeatureCollection where each Feature is a buffer around the corresponding indexed Feature of the input. The buffer could be either on the outside or the inside of the provided Feature, depending on the distance provided in the input. There must be either one distance provided per Feature in the FeatureCollection  input, or if only one distance is provided, then that distance is applied to every Feature in the collection. The positive (or negative) buffer of a geometry is defined as the Minkowski sum (or difference) of the geometry with a circle of radius equal to the absolute value of the buffer distance. The buffer API always returns a polygonal result. The negative or zero-distance buffer of lines and points is always an empty polygon. The input features are provided by a GeoJSON file which is uploaded via [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadPreview) and referenced by a unique udid. The GeoJSON file may contain a collection of Point, MultiPoint, Polygon, MultiPolygon, LineString and MultiLineString. GeometryCollection will be ignored if provided. \n\nTo test this API, you can upload the sample data from [Post Buffer API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/spatial/postbuffer#examples) examples(Request Body without distances array) via [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadPreview) and replace the [udid] from the [sample request below](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/spatial/getbuffer#examples) with the udid returned by Data Upload API."

  description: The list of distances (one per feature or one for all features), delimited by semicolons. For example, 12.34;-56.78. Positive distance will generate a buffer outside of the feature, whereas negative distance will generate a buffer inside of the feature. If the negative distance larger than the geometry itself, an empty polygon will be returned.

In summary, this security definition provides a solution  for modeling application(s) via objects capable of access control on specific APIs and scopes.\n\n#### Note\n* This security definition **requires** the use of the `x-ms-client-id` header to indicate which Azure Maps resource the application is requesting access to.  This can be acquired from the [Maps management API](https://aka.ms/amauthdetails).\n* The `Authorization URL` is specific to the Azure public cloud instance. Sovereign clouds have unique Authorization URLs and Azure Active directory configurations. \n* The Azure role based access control is configured from the [Azure management plane](https://aka.ms/amrbac) via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.\n* Usage of the [Azure Maps Web SDK](https://aka.ms/amaadmc) allows for configuration based setup of an application for multiple use cases.\n* Currently Azure Active Directory [v1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/azure-ad-endpoint-comparison) tokens are supported."

  description: This is a shared key which is provisioned when creating an [Azure Maps resource](https://aka.ms/amauth) through the Azure management plane  via Azure portal, Powershell, CLI, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs. With this key, any application is authorized to access  all REST APIs. In other words, these can currently be treated as master keys to the account which they are issued for.  For publicly exposed applications our recommendation is to use server to server access of Azure Maps REST APIs where this key can be  securely stored.
