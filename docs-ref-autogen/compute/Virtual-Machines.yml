operations:
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.assesspatches
  summary: Assess patches on the VM.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.capture
  summary: Captures the VM by copying virtual hard disks of the VM and outputs a template that can be used to create similar VMs.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.converttomanageddisks
  summary: Converts virtual machine disks from blob-based to managed disks. Virtual machine must be stop-deallocated before invoking this operation.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.createorupdate
  summary: The operation to create or update a virtual machine. Please note some properties can be set only during virtual machine creation.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.deallocate
  summary: Shuts down the virtual machine and releases the compute resources. You are not billed for the compute resources that this virtual machine uses.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.delete
  summary: The operation to delete a virtual machine.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.generalize
  summary: Sets the OS state of the virtual machine to generalized. It is recommended to sysprep the virtual machine before performing this operation. <br>For Windows, please refer to [Create a managed image of a generalized VM in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/capture-image-resource).<br>For Linux, please refer to [How to create an image of a virtual machine or VHD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/capture-image).
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.get
  summary: Retrieves information about the model view or the instance view of a virtual machine.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.installpatches
  summary: Installs patches on the VM.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.instanceview
  summary: Retrieves information about the run-time state of a virtual machine.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.list
  summary: Lists all of the virtual machines in the specified resource group. Use the nextLink property in the response to get the next page of virtual machines.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.listall
  summary: Lists all of the virtual machines in the specified subscription. Use the nextLink property in the response to get the next page of virtual machines.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.listavailablesizes
  summary: Lists all available virtual machine sizes to which the specified virtual machine can be resized.
- uid: management.azure.com.compute.virtualmachines.listbylocation
