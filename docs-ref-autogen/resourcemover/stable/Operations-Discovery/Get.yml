      Gets or sets Name of the API.

      The name of the operation being performed on this particular object. It should

      match the action name that appears in RBAC / the event service.

      Examples of operations include:

      * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/capture/action

      * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/restart/action

      * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/write

      * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/read

      * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/delete

      Each action should include, in order:

      (1) Resource Provider Namespace

      (2) Type hierarchy for which the action applies (e.g. server/databases for a SQL

      Azure database)

      (3) Read, Write, Action or Delete indicating which type applies. If it is a PUT/PATCH

      on a collection or named value, Write should be used.

      If it is a GET, Read should be used. If it is a DELETE, Delete should be used. If it

      is a POST, Action should be used.

      As a note: all resource providers would need to include the "{Resource Provider

      Namespace}/register/action" operation in their response.

      This API is used to register for their service, and should include details about the

      operation (e.g. a localized name for the resource provider + any special

      considerations like PII release).

      Gets or sets the provider.

      The localized friendly form of the resource provider name – it is expected to also

      include the publisher/company responsible.

      It should use Title Casing and begin with "Microsoft" for 1st party services.

      e.g. "Microsoft Monitoring Insights" or "Microsoft Compute.".

  - name: resource
    description: >-
      Gets or sets the resource.

      The localized friendly form of the resource related to this action/operation – it

      should match the public documentation for the resource provider.

      It should use Title Casing.

      This value should be unique for a particular URL type (e.g. nested types should *not*

      reuse their parent’s display.resource field)

      e.g. "Virtual Machines" or "Scheduler Job Collections", or "Virtual Machine VM Sizes"

      or "Scheduler Jobs".
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: operation
    description: >-
      Gets or sets the operation.

      The localized friendly name for the operation, as it should be shown to the user.

      Read any 'display.provider'  resource

      Create or Update any  'display.provider'  resource

      Delete any  'display.provider'  resource

      Perform any other action on any  'display.provider'  resource

      Prescriptive guidance for namespace:

      Read any 'display.resource' Create or Update any  'display.resource' Delete any
       'display.resource' 'ActionName' any 'display.resources'.
