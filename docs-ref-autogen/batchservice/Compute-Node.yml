operations:
- uid: batchservice.computenode.adduser
  summary: "Adds a user Account to the specified Compute Node.  \nYou can add a user Account to a Compute Node only when it is in the idle or running state."
- uid: batchservice.computenode.deleteuser
  summary: "Deletes a user Account from the specified Compute Node.  \nYou can delete a user Account to a Compute Node only when it is in the idle or running state."
- uid: batchservice.computenode.disablescheduling
  summary: "Disables Task scheduling on the specified Compute Node.  \nYou can disable Task scheduling on a Compute Node only if its current scheduling state is enabled."
- uid: batchservice.computenode.enablescheduling
  summary: "Enables Task scheduling on the specified Compute Node.  \nYou can enable Task scheduling on a Compute Node only if its current scheduling state is disabled"
- uid: batchservice.computenode.get
  summary: Gets information about the specified Compute Node.
- uid: batchservice.computenode.getremotedesktop
  summary: "Gets the Remote Desktop Protocol file for the specified Compute Node.  \nBefore you can access a Compute Node by using the RDP file, you must create a user Account on the Compute Node. This API can only be invoked on Pools created with a cloud service configuration. For Pools created with a virtual machine configuration, see the GetRemoteLoginSettings API."
- uid: batchservice.computenode.getremoteloginsettings
  summary: "Gets the settings required for remote login to a Compute Node.  \nBefore you can remotely login to a Compute Node using the remote login settings, you must create a user Account on the Compute Node. This API can be invoked only on Pools created with the virtual machine configuration property. For Pools created with a cloud service configuration, see the GetRemoteDesktop API."
- uid: batchservice.computenode.list
  summary: Lists the Compute Nodes in the specified Pool.
- uid: batchservice.computenode.reboot
  summary: "Restarts the specified Compute Node.  \nYou can restart a Compute Node only if it is in an idle or running state."
- uid: batchservice.computenode.reimage
  summary: "Reinstalls the operating system on the specified Compute Node.  \nYou can reinstall the operating system on a Compute Node only if it is in an idle or running state. This API can be invoked only on Pools created with the cloud service configuration property."
- uid: batchservice.computenode.updateuser
  summary: "Updates the password and expiration time of a user Account on the specified Compute Node.  \nThis operation replaces of all the updatable properties of the Account. For example, if the expiryTime element is not specified, the current value is replaced with the default value, not left unmodified. You can update a user Account on a Compute Node only when it is in the idle or running state."
- uid: batchservice.computenode.uploadbatchservicelogs
  summary: "Upload Azure Batch service log files from the specified Compute Node to Azure Blob Storage.  \nThis is for gathering Azure Batch service log files in an automated fashion from Compute Nodes if you are experiencing an error and wish to escalate to Azure support. The Azure Batch service log files should be shared with Azure support to aid in debugging issues with the Batch service."
