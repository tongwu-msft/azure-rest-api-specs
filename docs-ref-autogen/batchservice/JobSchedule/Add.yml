      A time after which no job will be created under this job schedule. The schedule will move to the completed state as soon as this deadline is past and there is no active job under this job schedule.

      If you do not specify a doNotRunAfter time, and you are creating a recurring job schedule, the job schedule will remain active until you explicitly terminate it.

      The time interval, starting from the time at which the schedule indicates a job should be created, within which a job must be created.

      If a job is not created within the startWindow interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no job will be created until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the job that is 'due' in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into the next recurrence interval. The default is infinite. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
    types:

    name: startWindow
  - description: >-
      The time interval between the start times of two successive jobs under the job schedule. A job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time.

      Because a job schedule can have at most one active job under it at any given time, if it is time to create a new job under a job schedule, but the previous job is still running, the Batch service will not create the new job until the previous job finishes. If the previous job does not finish within the startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new job will be scheduled for that interval. For recurring jobs, you should normally specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask, you will need an external process to monitor when jobs are created, add tasks to the jobs and terminate the jobs ready for the next recurrence. The default is that the schedule does not recur: one job is created, within the startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule is complete as soon as that job finishes. The minimum value is 1 minute. If you specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).

      Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).

    Specifies details of a Job Manager task.

    The Job Manager task is automatically started when the job is created. The Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager task before any other tasks in the job. When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries to preserve compute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as long as possible (that is, nodes running 'normal' tasks are removed before nodes running Job Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running tasks in the pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager task to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one job does not have priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be restarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job.

      Whether completion of the Job Manager task signifies completion of the entire job.

      If true, when the Job Manager task completes, the Batch service marks the job as complete. If any tasks are still running at this time (other than Job Release), those tasks are terminated. If false, the completion of the Job Manager task does not affect the job status. In this case, you should either use the onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their execution. The default value is true. If you are using the onAllTasksComplete and onTaskFailure attributes to control job lifetime, and using the Job Manager task only to create the tasks for the job (not to monitor progress), then it is important to set killJobOnCompletion to false.

      Whether the Job Manager task requires exclusive use of the compute node where it runs.

      If true, no other tasks will run on the same compute node for as long as the Job Manager is running. If false, other tasks can run simultaneously with the Job Manager on a compute node. The Job Manager task counts normally against the node's concurrent task limit, so this is only relevant if the node allows multiple concurrent tasks. The default value is true.

      The settings for an authentication token that the task can use to perform Batch service operations.

      If this property is set, the Batch service provides the task with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service operations without requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.

    A Job Preparation task to run before any tasks of the job on any given compute node.

    You can use Job Preparation to prepare a compute node to run tasks for the job. Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading common resource files used by all the tasks in the job. The Job Preparation task can download these common resource files to the shared location on the compute node. (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR\shared), or starting a local service on the compute node so that all tasks of that job can communicate with it. If the Job Preparation task fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before exiting with exit code 0), Batch will not run tasks of this job on the compute node. The node remains ineligible to run tasks of this job until it is reimaged. The node remains active and can be used for other jobs. The Job Preparation task can run multiple times on the same compute node. Therefore, you should write the Job Preparation task to handle re-execution. If the compute node is rebooted, the Job Preparation task is run again on the node before scheduling any other task of the job, if rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation task did not previously complete. If the compute node is reimaged, the Job Preparation task is run again before scheduling any task of the job.

      If true and the Job Preparation task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the Job Preparation task up to its maximum retry count (as specified in the constraints element). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service will not schedule tasks of the job to the compute node. The compute node remains active and eligible to run tasks of other jobs. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the Job Preparation task to complete. In this case, other tasks of the job can start executing on the compute node while the Job Preparation task is still running; and even if the Job Preparation task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node.

      The Job Preparation task is always rerun if a compute node is reimaged, or if the Job Preparation task did not complete (e.g. because the reboot occurred while the task was running). Therefore, you should always write a Job Preparation task to be idempotent and to behave correctly if run multiple times. The default value is true.

  description: >-
    A Job Release task to run on job completion on any compute node where the job has run.

    The Job Release task runs when the job ends, because of one of the following: The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API while the job is still active, the job's maximum wall clock time constraint is reached, and the job is still active, or the job's Job Manager task completed, and the job is configured to terminate when the Job Manager completes. The Job Release task runs on each compute node where tasks of the job have run and the Job Preparation task ran and completed. If you reimage a compute node after it has run the Job Preparation task, and the job ends without any further tasks of the job running on that compute node (and hence the Job Preparation task does not re-run), then the Job Release task does not run on that node. If a compute node reboots while the Job Release task is still running, the Job Release task runs again when the compute node starts up. The job is not marked as complete until all Job Release tasks have completed. The Job Release task runs in the background. It does not occupy a scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards the maxTasksPerNode limit specified on the pool.

      Both relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are relative to the task working directory. The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with "." it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in '.' and ends with .txt in the task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

      The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.

      The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network subnet which the compute nodes of the pool will join. This is of the form /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

      The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage on port 443.

      The maximum number of times the task may be retried.

      The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.

      If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
