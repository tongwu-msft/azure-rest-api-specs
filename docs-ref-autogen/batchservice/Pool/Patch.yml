  kind: object
  properties:
  - name: commandLine
    description: >-
      The command line of the start task.


      The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
    types:
    - uid: string
  - name: containerSettings
    description: >-
      The settings for the container under which the start task runs.


      When this is specified, all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task command line is executed in the container.

    types:

  - name: maxTaskRetryCount
    description: >-
      The maximum number of times the task may be retried.


      The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
    types:
    - uid: integer
  - name: waitForSuccess
    description: >-
      Whether the Batch service should wait for the start task to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node.


      If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.

    description: >-
      The location of the certificate store on the compute node into which to install the certificate.


      The default value is currentuser. This property is applicable only for pools configured with Windows nodes (that is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference). For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
    types:
    - uid: CertificateStoreLocation

    description: >-
      The name of the certificate store on the compute node into which to install the certificate.


      This property is applicable only for pools configured with Windows nodes (that is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference). Common store names include: My, Root, CA, Trust, Disallowed, TrustedPeople, TrustedPublisher, AuthRoot, AddressBook, but any custom store name can also be used. The default value is My.

      If this is omitted on a pool, and no default version is specified for this application, the request fails with the error code InvalidApplicationPackageReferences and HTTP status code 409. If this is omitted on a task, and no default version is specified for this application, the task fails with a pre-processing error.

      This URL must be readable using anonymous access; that is, the Batch service does not present any credentials when downloading the blob.
