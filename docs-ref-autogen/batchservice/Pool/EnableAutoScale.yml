### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Enables automatic scaling for a pool. You cannot enable automatic scaling on a pool if a resize operation is in progress on the pool. If automatic scaling of the pool is currently disabled, you must specify a valid autoscale formula as part of the request. If automatic scaling of the pool is already enabled, you may specify a new autoscale formula and/or a new evaluation interval. You cannot call this API for the same pool more than once every 30 seconds.

      The formula for the desired number of compute nodes in the pool.

      The formula is checked for validity before it is applied to the pool. If the formula is not valid, the Batch service rejects the request with detailed error information. For more information about specifying this formula, see Automatically scale compute nodes in an Azure Batch pool (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/batch-automatic-scaling).

    description: >-
      The time interval at which to automatically adjust the pool size according to the autoscale formula.

      The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum value are 5 minutes and 168 hours respectively. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes or greater than 168 hours, the Batch service rejects the request with an invalid property value error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). If you specify a new interval, then the existing autoscale evaluation schedule will be stopped and a new autoscale evaluation schedule will be started, with its starting time being the time when this request was issued.
