summary: "Enables automatic scaling for a pool.  \nYou cannot enable automatic scaling on a pool if a resize operation is in progress on the pool. If automatic scaling of the pool is currently disabled, you must specify a valid autoscale formula as part of the request. If automatic scaling of the pool is already enabled, you may specify a new autoscale formula and/or a new evaluation interval. You cannot call this API for the same pool more than once every 30 seconds."
