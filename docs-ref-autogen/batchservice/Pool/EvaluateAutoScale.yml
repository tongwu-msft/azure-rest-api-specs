### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Gets the result of evaluating an automatic scaling formula on the pool. This API is primarily for validating an autoscale formula, as it simply returns the result without applying the formula to the pool. The pool must have auto scaling enabled in order to evaluate a formula.

      The formula for the desired number of compute nodes in the pool.

      The formula is validated and its results calculated, but it is not applied to the pool. To apply the formula to the pool, 'Enable automatic scaling on a pool'. For more information about specifying this formula, see Automatically scale compute nodes in an Azure Batch pool (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/batch-automatic-scaling).
