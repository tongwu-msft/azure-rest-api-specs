### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Adds a collection of tasks to the specified job. Note that each task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not return the results for each task in the same order the tasks were submitted in this request. If the server times out or the connection is closed during the request, the request may have been partially or fully processed, or not at all. In such cases, the user should re-issue the request. Note that it is up to the user to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a request. For example, you should use the same task IDs during a retry so that if the prior operation succeeded, the retry will not create extra tasks unexpectedly. If the response contains any tasks which failed to add, a client can retry the request. In a retry, it is most efficient to resubmit only tasks that failed to add, and to omit tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt. The maximum lifetime of a task from addition to completion is 7 days. If a task has not completed within 7 days of being added it will be terminated by the Batch service and left in whatever state it was in at that time.

The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.

      The settings for an authentication token that the task can use to perform Batch service operations.

The token is provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment variable. The operations that the task can carry out using the token depend on the settings. For example, a task can request job permissions in order to add other tasks to the job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.

      Both relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are relative to the task working directory. The following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with "." it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: **\*.txt matches any file that does not start in '.' and ends with .txt in the task working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both \ and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.

For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task.
