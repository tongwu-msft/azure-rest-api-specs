    description: "The minimum time to retain the task directory on the compute node where it ran, from the time it completes execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete the task directory and all its contents.  \nThe default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be retained until the compute node is removed or reimaged."

    - uid: string
  - name: maxTaskRetryCount
    description: "The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero.  \nNote that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit."
