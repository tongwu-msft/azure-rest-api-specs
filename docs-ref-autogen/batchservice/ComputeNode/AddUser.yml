    isRequired: true
    description: The user name of the account.
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: name
  - in: body
    description: >-
      Whether the account should be an administrator on the compute node.

      The default value is false.
    types:
    - uid: boolean
    name: isAdmin
  - in: body
    description: >-
      The time at which the account should expire.

      If omitted, the default is 1 day from the current time. For Linux compute nodes, the expiryTime has a precision up to a day.
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: expiryTime
  - in: body
    description: >-
      The password of the account.

      The password is required for Windows nodes (those created with 'cloudServiceConfiguration', or created with 'virtualMachineConfiguration' using a Windows image reference). For Linux compute nodes, the password can optionally be specified along with the sshPublicKey property.
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: password
  - in: body
    description: >-
      The SSH public key that can be used for remote login to the compute node.

      The public key should be compatible with OpenSSH encoding and should be base 64 encoded. This property can be specified only for Linux nodes. If this is specified for a Windows node, then the Batch service rejects the request; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: sshPublicKey
requestHeader:
- in: header
  description: The caller-generated request identity, in the form of a GUID with no decoration such as curly braces, e.g. 9C4D50EE-2D56-4CD3-8152-34347DC9F2B0.
  types:
  - uid: string

  description: Whether the server should return the client-request-id in the response.
  types:
  - uid: boolean
  name: return-client-request-id
- in: header
  description: The time the request was issued. Client libraries typically set this to the current system clock time; set it explicitly if you are calling the REST API directly.
