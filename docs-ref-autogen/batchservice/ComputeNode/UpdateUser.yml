### YamlMime:RESTOperation
summary: Updates the password and expiration time of a user account on the specified compute node. This operation replaces of all the updateable properties of the account. For example, if the expiryTime element is not specified, the current value is replaced with the default value, not left unmodified. You can update a user account on a node only when it is in the idle or running state.

  - in: body
    description: >-
      The password of the account.

      The password is required for Windows nodes (those created with 'cloudServiceConfiguration', or created with 'virtualMachineConfiguration' using a Windows image reference). For Linux compute nodes, the password can optionally be specified along with the sshPublicKey property. If omitted, any existing password is removed.
    types:
    - uid: string
    name: password
  - in: body
    description: >-
      The time at which the account should expire.

      If omitted, the default is 1 day from the current time. For Linux compute nodes, the expiryTime has a precision up to a day.

  - in: body
    description: >-
      The SSH public key that can be used for remote login to the compute node.

      The public key should be compatible with OpenSSH encoding and should be base 64 encoded. This property can be specified only for Linux nodes. If this is specified for a Windows node, then the Batch service rejects the request; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request). If omitted, any existing SSH public key is removed.
