    description: "Details of a Job Manager task to be launched when the job is started.  \nThe Job Manager task is automatically started when the job is created. The Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager task before any other tasks in the job. When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries to preserve compute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as long as possible (that is, nodes running 'normal' tasks are removed before nodes running Job Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running tasks in the pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager task to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one job does not have priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level priorities are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job needs to be restarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job. Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of checkpointing."

The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows.
