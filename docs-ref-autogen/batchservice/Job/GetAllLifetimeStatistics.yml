      The total wall clock time of all tasks in the job.
       The wall clock time is the elapsed time from when the task started running on a compute node to when it finished (or to the last time the statistics were updated, if the task had not finished by then). If a task was retried, this includes the wall clock time of all the task retries.

  - description: >-
      The total number of tasks successfully completed in the job during the given time range.

      A task completes successfully if it returns exit code 0.
    types:
    - uid: integer
    name: numSucceededTasks
  - description: >-
      The total number of tasks in the job that failed during the given time range.

      A task fails if it exhausts its maximum retry count without returning exit code 0.
    types:
    - uid: integer
    name: numFailedTasks
  - description: The total number of retries on all the tasks in the job during the given time range.
    types:
    - uid: integer
    name: numTaskRetries
  - description: >-
      The total wait time of all tasks in the job.

      The wait time for a task is defined as the elapsed time between the creation of the task and the start of task execution. (If the task is retried due to failures, the wait time is the time to the most recent task execution.) This value is only reported in the account lifetime statistics; it is not included in the job statistics.
