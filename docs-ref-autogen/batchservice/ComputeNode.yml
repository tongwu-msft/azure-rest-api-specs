operations:
- uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.adduser
  summary: "Adds a user account to the specified compute node.  \nYou can add a user account to a node only when it is in the idle or running state."
- uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.deleteuser
  summary: "Deletes a user account from the specified compute node.  \nYou can delete a user account to a node only when it is in the idle or running state."
- uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.disablescheduling
  summary: "Disables task scheduling on the specified compute node.  \nYou can disable task scheduling on a node only if its current scheduling state is enabled."
- uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.enablescheduling
  summary: "Enables task scheduling on the specified compute node.  \nYou can enable task scheduling on a node only if its current scheduling state is disabled"
- uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.get
  summary: Gets information about the specified compute node.
- uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.getremotedesktop
  summary: "Gets the Remote Desktop Protocol file for the specified compute node.  \nBefore you can access a node by using the RDP file, you must create a user account on the node. This API can only be invoked on pools created with a cloud service configuration. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration, see the GetRemoteLoginSettings API."
- uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.getremoteloginsettings
  summary: "Gets the settings required for remote login to a compute node.  \nBefore you can remotely login to a node using the remote login settings, you must create a user account on the node. This API can be invoked only on pools created with the virtual machine configuration property. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, see the GetRemoteDesktop API."
- uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.list
  summary: Lists the compute nodes in the specified pool.
- uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.reboot
  summary: "Restarts the specified compute node.  \nYou can restart a node only if it is in an idle or running state."
- uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.reimage
  summary: "Reinstalls the operating system on the specified compute node.  \nYou can reinstall the operating system on a node only if it is in an idle or running state. This API can be invoked only on pools created with the cloud service configuration property."
- uid: batch.core.windows.net.batchservice.computenode.updateuser
  summary: "Updates the password and expiration time of a user account on the specified compute node.  \nThis operation replaces of all the updateable properties of the account.
