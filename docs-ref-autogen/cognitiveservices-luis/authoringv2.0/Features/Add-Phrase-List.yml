    description: An interchangeable phrase list feature serves as a list of synonyms for training. A non-exchangeable phrase list serves as separate features for training. So, if your non-interchangeable phrase list contains 5 phrases, they will be mapped to 5 separate features. You can think of the non-interchangeable phrase list as an additional bag of words to add to LUIS existing vocabulary features. It is used as a lexicon lookup feature where its value is 1 if the lexicon contains a given word or 0 if it doesn’t.  Default value is true.
