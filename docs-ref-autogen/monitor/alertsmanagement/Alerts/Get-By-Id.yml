summary: "Get a specific alert.  \nGet information related to a specific alert. If scope is a deleted resource then please use scope as parent resource of the delete resource. For example if my alert id is '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm1/providers/Microsoft.AlertsManagement/alerts/{alertId}' and 'vm1' is deleted then if you want to get alert by id then use parent resource of scope. So in this example get alert by id call will look like this: '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.AlertsManagement/alerts/{alertId}'."
