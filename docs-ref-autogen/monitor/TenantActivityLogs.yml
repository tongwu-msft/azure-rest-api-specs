  summary: Gets the Activity Logs for the Tenant.<br>Everything that is applicable to the API to get the Activity Logs for the subscription is applicable to this API (the parameters, $filter, etc.).<br>One thing to point out here is that this API does *not* retrieve the logs at the individual subscription of the tenant but only surfaces the logs that were generated at the tenant level.
